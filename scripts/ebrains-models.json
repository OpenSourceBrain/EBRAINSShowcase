It reproduces several empirical findings on internally generated hippocampal sequences (e.g., replays).

        "description": "Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI), [Muller et al. (2014)](http://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms4675) showed that the stimulus-evoked population response in the primary visual cortex of the awake monkey performing visual tasks propagates as a travelling wave, with consistent dynamics across trials. [Chemla et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2792-18.2019) further showed that these propagating waves are suppressive and suggested that their role is to increase the acuity of the visual system when presented with ambiguous stimuli.\n\nThis theoretical model accounts for the aforementioned phenomena. While a detailed model of a neocortical column has been published ([Markram et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2015.09.029)), its computational cost does not allow its generalization to a 12 cm2 spatial scale. The present model uses a mean-field formalism derived from networks of spiking neurons (adaptive exponential and fire AdEx model). Under this approach, proposed by [El Boustani and Destexhe (2009)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/neco.2009.02-08-710), the evolution of interconnected populations of neurons are described. Previous work allowed for the construction of 1-dimensional mean-field ring models ([Zerlaut et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10827-017-0668-2), [di Volo et al. (2019)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/neco_a_01173)). Indeed, the ring geometry offers a simple framework to investigate the emergence of spatio-temporal patterns of activity ([Hansel and Sompolinsky (1995)](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00158335)). The present implementation extends these models: a network of two cortical excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations, connected with physiological connectivity profiles, is spatially arranged in a 2-dimensional geometry. The stimulus-evoked response of the model is computed under mean-field formalism.",

Gurney,\nRoles for globus pallidus externa revealed in a computational model of action selection in the basal ganglia,\nNeural Networks,\nVolume 109,\n2019,\nPages 113-136,\nISSN 0893-6080,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2018.10.003.\n(http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608018302880)\n\nAbstract: The basal ganglia are considered vital to action selection - a hypothesis supported by several biologically plausible computational models. Of the several subnuclei of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus externa (GPe) has been thought of largely as a relay nucleus, and its intrinsic connectivity has not been incorporated in significant detail, in any model thus far. Here, we incorporate newly revealed subgroups of neurons within the GPe into an existing computational model of the basal ganglia, and investigate their role in action selection. Three main results ensued. First, using previously used metrics for selection, the new extended connectivity improved the action selection performance of the model. Second, low frequency theta oscillations were observed in the subpopulation of the GPe (the TA or \u2018arkypallidal\u2019 neurons) which project exclusively to the striatum. These oscillations were suppressed by increased dopamine activity \u2014 revealing a possible link with symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Third, a new phenomenon was observed in which the usual monotonic relationship between input to the basal ganglia and its output within an action \u2018channel\u2019 was, under some circumstances, reversed. Thus, at high levels of input, further increase of this input to the channel could cause an increase of the corresponding output rather than the more usually observed decrease. Moreover, this phenomenon was associated with the prevention of multiple channel selection, thereby assisting in optimal action selection. Examination of the mechanistic origin of our results showed the so-called \u2018prototypical\u2019 GPe neurons to be the principal subpopulation influencing action selection. They control the striatum via the arkypallidal neurons and are also able to regulate the output nuclei directly. Taken together, our results highlight the role of the GPe as a major control hub of the basal ganglia, and provide a mechanistic account for its control function.\n\nKeywords: Action selection; Network models; Globus pallidus externa; Arkypallidal GPe neurons; Prototypical GPe neurons",

        "description": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been successfully applied in various neurodegenerative diseases as an effective symptomatic treatment. However, its mechanisms of action within the brain network are still poorly understood. For an accurate prediction of the effects of DBS, we implement a detailed spiking model of the basal ganglia, which we combine with The Virtual Brain via our previously developed co-simulation environment. This multiscale co-simulation approach builds on the extensive previous literature of spiking models of the basal ganglia while simultaneously offering a whole-brain perspective on widespread effects of the stimulation going beyond the motor circuit. In the first demonstration of our model, we show that virtual DBS can move the firing rates of a Parkinson\u2019s disease patient\u2019s thalamus - basal ganglia network towards the healthy regime while, at the same time, altering the activity in distributed cortical regions with a pronounced effect in frontal regions. The developed modeling approach has the potential to optimize DBS lead placement and configuration and forecast the success of DBS treatment for individual patients.\nAll of the information necessary to re-run the analysis in the analysis of Meier et al.

        "description": "Many neurons possess dendrites enriched with sodium channels and are capable of generating action potentials. However, the role of dendritic sodium spikes remain unclear. Here, we study computational models of neurons to investigate the\nfunctional effects of dendritic spikes. In agreement with previous studies, we found that point neurons or neurons with passive dendrites increase their somatic firing rate in response to the correlation of synaptic bombardment for a wide range of\ninput conditions, i.e. input firing rates, synaptic conductances, or refractory periods. However, neurons with active dendrites show the opposite behavior: for a wide range of conditions the firing rate decreases as a function of correlation. We found this property in three types of models of dendritic excitability: a Hodgkin-Huxley model of dendritic spikes, a model with integrate and fire dendrites, and a discrete-state dendritic model. We conclude that fast dendritic spikes confer much broader computational properties to neurons, sometimes opposite to that of point neurons.\n\nThe results of model simulations were published in:\nG\u00f3rski, Tomasz, et al. \"Dendritic sodium spikes endow neurons with inverse firing rate response to correlated synaptic activity.\" Journal of computational neuroscience 45.3 (2018): 223-234.

The model is based on a bi-dimensional grid of neural populations, interconnected by long-range synaptic connectivity, which reflects the modular organization of the cortex.\n\nTwo implementations of the model are available. From one side, a NEST version of the model is distributed, in order to make it available to the large scientific community. At the same time, the model was also implemented using the proprietary mixed time and event driven DPSNN (Distributed Simulator of Plastic Spiking Neural Networks) simulator. In this natively distributed and parallel engine, the full neural system is represented by a network of C++ processes equipped with a communication infrastructure that can be easily interfaced with both Message Passing Interface (MPI) and custom software/hardware communication systems.\n\nThe simulations of different dynamical brain states constitute a challenge for parallel simulation of large multi-scale models of the brain. In DPSNN, efficient simulations resulted from the optimization of both the computational power and the inter-process communications. For this reason, speed-up measures as well as strong and weak scaling analysis was performed on the model simulated on DPSNN (Pastorelli et al, 2019).\n\nWe explored networks up to 192\u00d7192 modules, each composed of 1,250 integrate-and-fire neurons with spike-frequency adaptation, and exponentially decaying inter-modular synaptic connectivity with varying spatial decay constant.

Numerical simulations indicated that granule cells have a compact electrotonic structure allowing EPSPs to diffuse with little attenuation from dendrites to axon. The spike arose almost simultaneously along the whole axonal ascending branch and invaded the hillock, whose activation promoted spike back-propagation with marginal delay (<200 micros) and attenuation (<20 mV) into the somato-dendritic compartment.

The Adaptive Exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx) model has emerged as a convenient \u201cmiddle-ground\u201d model. With a low computational cost, but keeping biophysical interpretation of the parameters it has been extensively used for simulation of large neural networks. However, because of its current-based adaptation, it can generate unrealistic behaviors. We show the limitations of the AdEx model, and to avoid them, we introduce the Conductance-based Adaptive Exponential integrate-and-fire model (CAdEx). We give an analysis of the dynamic of the CAdEx model and we show the variety of firing patterns that it can produce. We propose the CAdEx model as a richer alternative to perform network simulations with simplified models reproducing neuronal intrinsic properties.\n\nHere is a implementation of CAdEx model using Brian2 neuronal simulator and Python language.",

        "description": "This work, co-supervised in Destexhe and Jirsa groups, aims at connecting empirical knowledge across scales from microscopic (nanometers to micrometers\u2014molecules to whole neurons) to macroscopic brain activity (centimeters to meters\u2014brain areas to individual subjects' brains) with theoretical tools (Goldman et al. 2019). Not unlike how microscopic interactions between molecules underlie structures formed in macroscopic states of matter, using statistical physics, the dynamics of microscopic neural phenomena can be linked to macroscopic brain dynamics through mesoscopic scales. While statistical physics has been utile to describe the patterns of pair-wise and population-wide correlations at the microscopic scale in brain research (Nghiem, Telenczuk, et al. 2018; Schneidman et al. 2006) such tools have not yet been employed to formally bridge from microscopic to macroscopic scales. \n\nHere, methods for the macroscopic quantification of neural activity are introduced (Equations 1 and 2, Fig.1) and used to quantify global brain dynamics in states spanning deep sleep to resting and active wakefulness. In essence, spectral energy (U; equation 1) is defined as the integral under the Fourier power spectrum and the spectral entropy (H; equation 2) is defined as the log of the empirical probability distribution of frequencies (P(f)). These measures are made from each subject and each sensor in short time epochs, acknowledging that brain activity is constantly in flux. In magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals from healthy human subjects in resting (Fig.2A top) and active (Fig.2A bottom) states, effective energy and entropy measurements were made from power spectra (Fig.2B) for each epoch. Plotting the energy and entropy for each epoch from one subject, a robust linear relationship between the spectral energy and entropy is apparent (Fig.2C). Histograms show a shift of entropy to higher values and a shift of energy to lower values during active waking compared to resting wakefulness.  \n\nExamining the mean effective energy and entropy for each subject, it is clear that entropy robustly increases (Fig.2D) whereas energy robustly decreases (Fig.2E) during active waking compared to rest. Further, this conserved relationship between mean effective energy and entropy is also observed in electroencephalography data from subjects ranging from deep sleep to wake (Fig.2F). To test whether increased coupling between the system\u2019s components and therefore synchrony could account for the higher energy and lower entropy during less active brain states, coupling was systematically varied in a network of coupled Kuramoto oscillators. Indeed, enhanced coupling can result in lower entropy, higher energy signals (Fig.3). The results indicate that macroscopically observed high synchrony, low complexity brain signals recorded during unconscious states may be accounted for by an increased coupling in the system's components, behaving more like a solid (Peyrache et al. 2012; Le Van Quyen et al. 2016; Olcese et al. 2016; Nghiem, Lina, et al. 2018). In contrast, conscious brain states may be described as less ordered, higher complexity (Sitt et al. 2014; Engemann et al. 2018; Nghiem, Lina, et al. 2018), more liquid-like. \n\nNext, we sought to determine whether phenomenological changes in microscopic coupling can be biophysically described by known differences in neuromodulation between brain states, and whether microscopic effects of neuromodulation can account for global differences in macroscopic brain dynamics. To this end, mean-field approximations describing populations of excitatory and inhibitory networks (El Boustani and Destexhe 2009; Volo et al. 2019) were connected based on diffusion tractography from human brains to be incorporated as nodes in TVB (Sanz-Leon et al. 2015), thus generating whole human brain simulations (Fig.4). Full brain TVB-AdEX models display spontaneous dynamics sensitive to the effects of neuromodulation, with low entropy, high energy states resulting from increased excitatory spike frequency adaptation resulting from decreased neuromodulation, as is the case in unconscious brain states. Conversely, TVB-AdEX models display spontaneous dynamics that are high entropy and low energy, similar to conscious brain states, when excitatory spike frequency adaptation is low, as is the case due to the enhancement of neuromodulatory signaling during waking and especially attentive brain states.\n\n![Figure 1](https://object.cscs.ch/v1/AUTH_64bf8536ad8b4872a4121f909be7e82f/DestexheTeam/Goldman/Fig1_GoldmanSGA2_300px.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 1**: Quantifying observables in different brain states. A spectral energy measure, U, is introduced for each time epoch from each subject in each brain state (equation 1), calculated as the integral of each power spectrum. Similarly, a spectral entropy measure is defined, for each epoch from each subject in each brain state, where, P(f) describes the relative heights of power spectral frequency bins (equation 2).\n\n![Figure 2](https://object.cscs.ch/v1/AUTH_64bf8536ad8b4872a4121f909be7e82f/DestexheTeam/Goldman/Fig2_GoldmanSGA2_400px.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 2**: Decreased spectral energy and increased spectral entropy in more active brain states. (A) Magentoencephalography (MEG) signals (X) from human subjects in resting and active states are used to compute (B) power spectra (X) for each subject, state, sensor, and epoch. Spectral energy (Eq.1) and entropy (Eq.2) are calculated from power spectra. (C) Energy and entropy across epochs for one subject in resting and active waking states. Between brain states, a significant shift in energy and entropy (Mann-Whitney U test, p-values reported) can be seen in histograms as well as a change in slope and intercept of the negative linear energy-entropy relation (best fit line shown, Pearson's r reported) as shown in the scatter plot. The inset labeled dS, dU implies a non-tautological relation between effective energy and entropy as measured empirically. Briefly, shifting power spectral offset results in changed energy values with no effect on entropy. Conversely, shuffling spectral energy between modes modulates the effective entropy, but not the energy. Variation of the spectral energy-entropy relation between brain states is robust across subjects. Mean spectral entropy (D) and mean spectral energy (E) are shown in active state against rest (one point per subject, identity line shown). In the resting state, spectral entropy is consistently smaller and energy larger than in the active state (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Mean values of effective energy and entropy are shown from an independent dataset of electroencephalography, confirming the conservation of energy-entropy relationship across states of sleeping as well as waking (F).\n\n![Figure 3](https://object.cscs.ch/v1/AUTH_64bf8536ad8b4872a4121f909be7e82f/DestexheTeam/Goldman/Fig3_GoldmanSGA2_400px.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 3**: Coupling modulates spectral energy and entropy. A parameter exploration of the Kuramoto model is performed in order to investigate effects of coupling on effective energy and entropy. Changing coupling strength, K, between oscillators causes a shift in spectral state variables. Increasing coupling robustly enhances the signal magnitude (A-D), captured by increased spectral energy (E) and diminishes signal complexity (A-D), quantified as diminished spectral entropy (E).\n\n![](https://object.cscs.ch/v1/AUTH_64bf8536ad8b4872a4121f909be7e82f/DestexheTeam/Goldman/Fig4_GoldmanSGA2_400px.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 4**: Neuromodulation-induced, microscopic changes in spike-frequency adaptation can account for macroscopic changes in state variables between brain states. Mean-field models of adaptive exponential excitatory and inhibitory neurons (adapted from Volo et al. 2019) represent nodes coupled together based on diffusion MRI tractography (A). Spike-frequency adaptation is increased to model the effects of decreased neuromodulation present during unconscious compared to conscious brain states (B-D). Enhancing excitatory spike frequency adaptation in the TVB-AdEx model results in a transition from small magnitude complex signals characteristic of waking brain states to slow waves characteristic of unconscious brain states.\n\n### References\n\nEl Boustani, Sami, and Alain Destexhe. 2009. \u201cA Master Equation Formalism for Macroscopic Modeling of Asynchronous Irregular Activity States.\u201d Neural Computation 21 (1): 46\u2013100.\n\nEngemann, Denis A., Federico Raimondo, Jean-R\u00e9mi King, Benjamin Rohaut, Gilles Louppe, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Faugeras, Jitka Annen, et al. 2018. \u201cRobust EEG-Based Cross-Site and Cross-Protocol Classification of States of Consciousness.\u201d Brain: A Journal of Neurology 141 (11): 3179\u201392.\n\nGoldman, Jennifer S., N\u00faria Tort-Colet, Matteo di Volo, Eduarda Susin, Jules Bout\u00e9, Melissa Dali, Mallory Carlu, Trang-Anh Nghiem, Tomasz G\u00f3rski, and Alain Destexhe. 2019. \u201cBridging Single Neuron Dynamics to Global Brain States.\u201d Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience 13 (December): 75.\n\nLe Van Quyen, Michel, Lyle E.

        "description": "Neocortical processing of sensory input relies on the specific activation of subpopulations within the cortical network. Though specific circuitry is thought to be the primary mechanism underlying this functional principle, we explore here a putative complementary mechanism: whether diverse biophysical features in single neurons contribute to such differential activation. In a previous study, we reported that, in young mice visual cortex, individual neurons differ not only in their excitability but also in their sensitivities to the properties of the membrane potential fluctuations. In the present work, we analyze how this heterogeneity is translated into diverse input-output properties in the context of low synchrony population dynamics. As expected, we found that individual neurons couple differentially to specific form of presynaptic activity (emulating afferent stimuli of various properties) mostly because of their differences in excitability. However, we also found that the response to proximal dendritic input was controlled by the sensitivity to the speed of the fluctuations (which can be linked to various levels of density of sodium channels and sodium inactivation). Our study thus proposes a novel quantitative insight into the functional impact of biophysical heterogeneity: because of their various firing responses to fluctuations, individual neurons will differentially couple to local network activity.\nVersion published in Plos Comp Biol",

This is then used to build large-scale brain network models for the resting state Functional Connectivity and the predictive value of the tracer data is compared and validated against SC derived from diffusion MRI scans. \n\nThe top-down model systematically exploits the effects of the SC constraints upon network dynamics, and was compared with empirical cortical activation maps in SP1, in healthy, stroke and rehabilitation. The model allows systematic analysis of the structural impact of the stroke and of the recovery. This leads to the best fit for parameters which were in agreement with the experimental results for the structural damage during the stroke and the recovery (petkoski et al, in prep). \nData analysis and modelling were performed for recordings of one hemisphere of one animal (SP1 data), and further recordings from both hemispheres are expected from 4 more animals.\n\nReferences:\nF.

        "description": "Partners within the framework of CDP4 have developed a rate neuron model of the saccade generator (SG) in the reticular formation (RF). The model was implemented by UM partner, which consisted of an implementation in NEST of a model proposed by Gancarz & Grossberg (1998). The SG consists of a horizontal and a vertical component each with two long-lead burst neurons (LLBNs), excitatory burst neurons (EBNs), inhibitory burst neurons (IBNs), and tonic neurons (TNs). Within each component, the two directions (left-right, down-up) interact antagonistically. Additionally, both components share a single omnipause neuron (OPN) which tonically inhibits each EBN as long as no saccade is being initiated. Based on network interactions among these RF neurons, the model reproduces typical neuronal activation profiles (Fig. 1A) observed during saccade generation, realistic saccade trajectories (Fig. 1B), and cell tuning properties (Fig. 1C). This model forms the back-end of a larger architecture of visuo-motor integration, transforming eye-displacement vectors obtained from a previous visual target selection process into motor commands for the eye muscles.\n\n#### Publications\nSenden, M., Schuecker, J., Hahne, J., Diesmann, M., and Goebel, R.

        "description": "A model of the basal ganglia system was presented in Lindahl M, Hellgren Kotaleski J. (2017) Untangling Basal Ganglia Network Dynamics and Function: Role of Dopamine Depletion and Inhibition Investigated in a Spiking Network Model. eNeuro. 2017 Jan 12;3(6). pii: ENEURO.0156-16.2016. [doi: 10.1523/ENEURO.0156-16.2016](https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0156-16.2016).\n\nThe basal ganglia are a crucial brain system for behavioral selection, and their function is disturbed in Parkinson's disease (PD), where neurons exhibit inappropriate synchronization and oscillations. We present a spiking neural model of basal ganglia including plausible details on synaptic dynamics, connectivity patterns, neuron behavior, and dopamine effects. Recordings of neuronal activity in the subthalamic nucleus and Type A (TA; arkypallidal) and Type I (TI; prototypical) neurons in globus pallidus externa were used to validate the model. Simulation experiments predict that both local inhibition in striatum and the existence of an indirect pathway are important for basal ganglia to function properly over a large range of cortical drives. The dopamine depletion-induced increase of AMPA efficacy in corticostriatal synapses to medium spiny neurons (MSNs) with dopamine receptor D2 synapses (CTX-MSN D2) and the reduction of MSN lateral connectivity (MSN-MSN) were found to contribute significantly to the enhanced synchrony and oscillations seen in PD. Additionally, reversing the dopamine depletion-induced changes to CTX-MSN D1, CTX-MSN D2, TA-MSN, and MSN-MSN couplings could improve or restore basal ganglia action selection ability. In summary, we found multiple changes of parameters for synaptic efficacy and neural excitability that could improve action selection ability and at the same time reduce oscillations. Identification of such targets could potentially generate ideas for treatments of PD and increase our understanding of the relation between network dynamics and network function.\nThis is the published version in [doi: 10.1523/ENEURO.0156-16.2016](https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0156-16.2016)",

Training is conducted in a deep reinforcement learning setting, that is, the agent learns by exploring its environment through initially random actions and gradually adjusting its policy network to maximize a task-specific reward. As a precursor to the in-hand object manipulation task this system is eventually applied to, we have trained the agent on the archetypal task of reaching. Here, the agent must steer the joints of the hand to join random fingers with the thumb above the palm. To that end, our model is a recurrent neural network. The input to this network are the current angles and velocities of the hand's joints, as well as the target positions of the fingertips. This information is abstracted in 4 fully connected layers followed by one gated recurrent unit, which the agent can utilize to represent memory in the policy. The network's output are the parameters of a Beta distributed joint probability density function. Each marginal distribution corresponds to one joint and represents the absolute angle into which the agent wants to move this joint at the current timestep. The actual target angle communicated to the simulation is sampled from this distribution randomly.\nAn artificial neural network modeling the frontoparietal network of the primate brain with macro-level plausibility has been trained from scratch to manipulate a cube by controlling an anthropomorphic robotic hand (in simulation). The provided files comprise network weight and preprocessing parameters. Model definitions and task simulations can be found in the repository. The pretrained model can be used for further training or analysis.",

The biophysical mechanisms underlying this form of plasticity are currently not known. We present here a biophysical model which captures the characteristics of STDP, such as its frequency dependency, and the effects of spike pair or spike triplet interactions. We also make links with other well-known plasticity rules. A simplified phenomenological model is also derived, which should be useful for fast numerical simulation and analytical investigation of the impact of STDP at the network level.",

        "description": "The virtual patient brain network model allows a novel approach to brain interventions based on large-scale brain network based models that are derived from non- invasive structural data of individual patients. The Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP) model provides the perfect test bed for clinical hypothesis testing of questions linked to network-based mechanisms. \nLarge-scale brain network models in general, and the VEP brain model in particular, have three critical components, network connectivity, neural mass model and MRI lesions. First, procedures to reconstruct connectivity from dMRI data nowadays reliably extract structural network connectivity with high anatomical precision (Johansen-Berg and Berhens, 2009) and efforts are on the way to develop more advanced methods proving robust and reproducible on subject and group levels (Besson et al., 2014). Thus there is hope that patient specific connectomes may soon enter in clinical routine use. Second, neural mass models are placed at the network nodes and determine the dynamic nature of the interactions. Neural mass models need not necessarily to be derived from biophysical mechanisms, but rather need to capture the dynamic repertoire of the neural population. It is in this dynamical sense that they have to be biophysically realistic, not in the traditional bottom-up causal sense. In epilepsy, the Epileptor is a neural mass model that has been derived purely based on mathematical reasoning. It provides a complete taxonomy of epileptic seizures including onset, offset and seizure evolution characteristics. Once a seizure type has been determined for a particular patient, then the taxonomy by (Jirsa et al., 2014) offers a mathematical formulation of a generative model that can be used as a network node in the VEP model. Third, integration of MRI lesions into the VEP model is possible, but not evident due to the challenge in translating the lesion into model parameters. Reasonable candidates are excitability and local connectivity, because localized tis- sue abnormalities are likely to alter these two parameters in the context of our network perspective. MRI lesions provide a spatial map of altered parameters that thus enter into the VEP model and affect the network dynamics. The emergent dynamic effects, that are the seizures in the current context, will crucially depend on the interplay between net- work node model (Epileptor), patient specific structural connectivity (from dMRI), and spatial maps of excitability (EZ, PZ) and MRI lesions.\n\nThe model allows reconstructing epileptic patients\u2019 brain networks, using their specific anatomical properties and the Epileptor, a neural mass model that captures the temporal evolution of a seizure including on- and offset. Based on clinical hypothesis of the epileptogenic zone (EZ), the model can reproduce seizure propagation in silico as observed empirically with SEEG electrodes implanted in the patient. These propagation patterns cannot be captured by functional connectivity due to their inherent non-stationarity. \nThe model allows modeling that includes the following steps: \n1) Proix et al (2016) built the processing chain of all structural images (dMRI, MRI) required to build a virtual brain. \n2) Jirsa et al (2017) demonstrated the methodology and proof of concept of how to create personalized models and fit them against empirical neuroimaging data. 3) Proix et al (2017) performed a pilot study (N=15), where we computed a score estimating the difference between the EZ identified by the brain model, and that identified by the clinicians during pre-surgical evaluation. This study demonstrated the favourable correlation between model prediction and surgery outcome. In other words: negative surgery outcome correlates with surgery not performed in line with model predictions.\n\n### References: \nJirsa, V. K. et al.

        "description": "The UNIC partner has studied the activity and responsiveness of cortical networks of Adaptive Exponential (AdEx) integrate and fire neurons, using a similar model as described previously (Destexhe, JCNS, 2009; see this paper for all details about the methods).  Such networks can be used to simulate the different firing patterns of excitatory (\u201cregular spiking\u201d or RS) and inhibitory (\u201cfast spiking\u201d or FS) neurons (Fig. 1A).  RS-FS networks display different states ranging from synchronous-regular (SR) to asynchronous-irregular (AI) states (Fig. 1B).  Interestingly, the response of the network was higher in the AI state, compared to any other state of the network (Fig. 1C-D).  The responsiveness of the network can be understood from reconstructing the transfer function of its neurons (Fig. 1E-F).\n\nRemarkably, one can see that the AI state is highly responsive (Fig. 1D), but not all AI states produce the same response.  This was due to the fact that one of the network (VA-2005) had a too strong conductance, while the RS-FS network was tuned to the conductances measured experimentally in vivo (Fig. 1E).  Reconstructing the theoretical transfer function from these two networks shows that the strong conductance shifted the response of the neurons to high input weights, which explains the lack of responsiveness (Fig. 1F, green).  On the other hand, the RS-FS network displayed a response curve which was overlapping with the stimulus (Fig. 1F, blue) and thus the network was responsive to this input.\n\nTo investigate larger-scale consequences of this responsiveness, we simulated a paradigm consisting of successive layers of RS-FS networks (Fig. 2).  A pulse packet given as input in the first layer could reliably propagate across layers, but only in the AI state (Fig. 2B).  Such a propagation was not possible in AI states that had implausible conductance levels (not shown). \n\nWe conclude that AI state provide very interesting responsiveness properties, but only if they have a physiologically realistic conductance level.  This was confirmed by analyzing a very wide range of AI states (Girones and Destexhe, 2017).  This property makes them able to detect inputs and propagate them across layers.  This may explain why the awake brain is always associated to \u201cdesynchronized\u201d activity, and why the brain switches to this type of activity when performing a task, or attending to stimuli.  We thus propose that AI states can implement a low-level form of sensory awareness (Zerlaut and Destexhe, 2017).\n\n**[Program code of the model is available in ModelDB](https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/ShowModel?model=234992#tabs-1)**\n\n**[PyNN program code of the model in ZIP](https://mycore.core-cloud.net/index.php/s/8N0DCUjHgrTbtPr)**\n\n\n\nPublications\n\nZerlaut Y. and Destexhe A.

This approach is very powerful because one can use it to design mean-field models from complex neural models.  It was applied first to networks of AdEx neurons with conductance-based synaptic interactions [1].  The formalism was later extended to include spike-frequency adaptation [2], which enabled us to obtain mean-field models that very finely capture the time course and amplitude of response to external stimulation.  At the end of SGA2, we took it one step further by designing mean-field models of even more complex models, the Morris-Lecar model and the well-known Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model [3].  The mean-field model captures the level of spontaneous activity and the dynamics of response of networks of HH neurons.  In SGA3, we plan to apply this formalism to detailed models based on morphological reconstructions.\n\nIt is important to note that part of this work was obtained during the EITN Spring School of Computational Neuroscience, and we decided to put the students as co-first authors of the resulting article [3].\n\nA copy of the code of this model was put in open-access on [ModelDB]( https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/ShowModel?model=263259)\n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Zerlaut, Y., Chemla, S., Chavane, F. and Destexhe, A.

        "description": "The UNIC partner has designed a mean-field model of neuronal population activity, for networks of Adaptive Exponential (AdEx) integrate and fire neurons.  The model of spiking neurons (used as a reference) was a similar model as described previously (Destexhe, JCNS, 2009; see this paper for all details about the methods).  The network was based on two different cell types, excitatory (\u201cregular spiking\u201d or RS) and inhibitory (\u201cfast spiking\u201d or FS) neurons.  The mean-field model of RS-FS networks was based on a Master Equation Formalism proposed previously (El Boustani and Destexhe, 2009).  \n\nWe report here the first results of a mean-field model of RS-FS networks.  Such a model requires to compute the transfer functions of the different cell types, which we have done for RS and FS cells, numerically.  The mean-field model obtained was then tested against numerical simulations of the network.  The mean-field model was able to capture the distribution of firing rates during spontaneous activity (Fig. 1), as well as the response of the network to external excitatory inputs (Fig. 2).   One can see that the mean-field predicts well the activity of these networks, as well as the temporal dynamics of their responses to simple stimuli.  However, the peak and the tail of the responses were not perfectly fit, mostly because of the presence of adaptation in RS cells.  The inclusion of an adaptation term is currently being investigated.\n\nAn extension of the model is towards including measurements of transfer functions from real cortical neurons.  The transfer function is a central piece of the mean-field formalism, it maps the output of the neuron (expressed as a rate) as a function of its excitatory and inhibitory inputs.  One great advantage of the Master Equation formalism (El Boustani and Destexhe, 2009) is that it can be applied to any network of neurons, provided their transfer functions are known.  It was initially applied networks of integrate-and-fire neurons, connected with conductance-based synapses, and the formalism successfully predicted the state space of such networks (El Boustani and Destexhe, 2009).  It was more recently applied to more complex neuron types, such as the AdEx model (Zerlaut and Destexhe, 2017).  Here, the transfer function was obtained using a semi-analytical procedure, where a mathematical template was fit to numerical simulations (Zerlaut and Destexhe, 2017).   The resulting mean-field model could predict not only the level of spontaneous activity, but also the response of the network to external stimuli, as shown above.\n\nThe same approach could be followed for more complex neurons, and it was applied to real neurons from mouse V1 (Zerlaut et al., 2016).  In this approach, the same mathematical template was used and was constrained to recordings of neurons using conductance-based inputs injected using the dynamic-clamp technique.  This technique allowed us to measure the transfer function from 30 neurons, electrophysiologically identified as RS neurons.  However, the experiments revealed a very strong cell-to-cell diversity of transfer functions, which could only be accounted by diversity in the level of excitability of the neurons.  Mean-field models based on real neurons are potentially powerful because they can be used to match population recordings from real data - this new type of mean-field model will be investigated in SGA2.\n\nPublications\n\nZerlaut Y. and Destexhe A.

        "description": "The tight loop through the cerebellar cortex and the inferior olivary nucleus likely subserves the functions of motor coordination, sequence learning and precise timing, commonly ascribed to the olivo-cerebellar system.\n\nA substantial proportion of Inferior olivary cells are known to produce robust subthreshold membrane potential oscillations, *in vivo* as *in vitro*, which cause the cells to respond to stimuli in a phase dependent manner, both in latency and in response probabilities. Furthermore, strong electrotonic coupling of olivary cells is known to synchronize these subthreshold oscillations, which may provide the system with the means to coordinate and time neuronal populations during motor action. In the olivary network, coupling between neighboring cells leads to topographical propagations of membrane potential differences across cells, which results in the coupling of the response probabilities.\n\nParticularly, the coupling of cells is hypothesized to lead to the formation of quasisynchronous spiking. This is presumably due to a combination of anatomical clustering and coupled oscillations.\n\nIt is therefore hypothesized that phase differences between coupled cells in the larger olivo-cerebellar network will lead to state dependent network responses, with predictable firing statistics. In the cerebellar cortex, given that Purkinje cells are innervated by individual olivary neurons, invariant phase differences of olivary cells\u2019 subthreshold oscillations would translate into specific sequences of Purkinje cell firing. As such sequences are made state dependent due to the coupled subthreshold oscillations of olivary cells, this leads to predictable statistics of Purkinje cell firing, which can be measured as response latencies and probabilities.\n\nThis model allows the inspection of firing patterns and of dynamical clustering in a model of the entire inferior olive of the mouse. It is written for the Arbor simulator in Python.\nThis is the first release of a simplified version of the model, which can run on a single CPU under 30 seconds.",

        "description": "Knowledge integration based on the relationship between structure and function of the neural substrate is one of the main targets of neuroinformatics and data-driven computational modeling. However, the multiplicity of data sources, the diversity of benchmarks, the mixing of observables of different natures, and the necessity of a long-term, systematic approach make such a task challenging. Here we present a first snapshot of a long-term integrative modeling program designed to address this issue in the domain of the visual system: a comprehensive spiking model of cat primary visual cortex. The presented model satisfies an extensive range of anatomical, statistical and functional constraints under a wide range of visual input statistics. In the presence of physiological levels of tonic stochastic bombardment by spontaneous thalamic activity, the modelled cortical reverberations self-generate a sparse asynchronous ongoing activity that quantitatively matches a range of experimentally measured statistics. When integrating feed-forward drive elicited by a high diversity of visual contexts, the simulated network produces a realistic, quantitatively accurate interplay between visually evoked excitatory and inhibitory conductances; contrast-invariant orientation- tuning width; center surround interactions; and stimulus-dependent changes in the precision of the neural code. This integrative model offers insights into how the studied properties interact, contributing to a better understanding of visual cortical dynamics. It provides a basis for future development towards a comprehensive model of low-level perception.\n\n### 1.1 Running the different experiments:\n\nFirst, in `run_parameter_search.py`, replace the field `[PATH_TO_ENV]` by the path of the activate executable of your virtual environment (for example, `$HOME/virt_env/mozaik/bin/activate)`\n\n#### Drifting grating and natural images protocol\n```\npython run_parameter_search.py run.py nest param/defaults \n```\n(~10h of runtime with our setup).  If not using slurm (results might slightly differ from the preprint):\n```\nmpirun -n 16 python run.py nest 1 param/defaults SelfSustainedPushPull\n```\n\n#### Size tuning protocol\n```\npython run_parameter_search.py run_stc.py nest param/defaults\n```\n (~10h of runtime with our setup). If not using slurm (results might slightly differ from the preprint):\n```\nmpirun -n 16 python run_stc.py nest 1 param/defaults SelfSustainedPushPull\n```\n\n#### Spontaneous activity protocol::\n```\npython run_parameter_search.py run_spont.py nest param_spont/defaults \n```\n(~1h30 of runtime with our setup). If not using slurm (results might slightly differ from the preprint):\n```\nmpirun -n 16 python run_spont.py nest 1 param_spont/defaults SelfSustainedPushPull\n```\n\n### 1.2 Description of the files:\n        \n- analysis\\_and\\_visualization.py: Contains the code for the different analysis and plotting. The function `perform_analysis_and_visualization` runs the analysis and the plots corresponding to the fullfield drifting grating and natural images protocol. The functions `perform_analysis_and_visualization_stc` and `perform_analysis_and_visualization_spont` do the same respectively for the size tuning and spontaneous activity protocol.\n- experiments.py: Defines for each protocol which experiments will be run as well as their parameters. `create_experiments` corresponds to the fullfield drifting grating protocol, `create_experiments_stc` corresponds to the size tuning protocol, and `create_experiments_spont` corresponds to the spontaneous activity protocol.\n- eye\\_path.pickle: Contains the coordinates of the eye path that is used by default in the natural image protocol. \n- image\\_naturelle\\_HIGHC.bmp: The natural image that is used by default in the natural image protocol.\n- model.py: Contains the code which creates each layers of the model and build the connections based on the parameters used to run the model.\n- or\\_map\\_new\\_16x16: Contains the precomputed orientation map. A specific central portion of it can be cropped based on the or_map_stretch parameters.\n- param: Defines the parameters used in the fullfield drifting gratings and natural images protocol as well as for the size tuning protocol. The 'default' file contains the basic parameters of the model as well as the path of the parameters corresponding to each sheets of the model. `SpatioTemporalFilterRetinaLGN_defaults` contains the parameters of the input model as well as the parameters of the LGN neurons. `l4_cortex_exc`, `l4_cortex_inh`, `l23_cortex_exc`, `l23_cortex_inh` contains the parameters of each cortical population as well as the parameters of the connections of the model. Each '\\_rec' file contains the recording parameters for each population of the model.\n- param\\_spont: Contains the parameters for the spontaneous activity protocol of the model. The only difference with the `param` directory resides in the recording parameters.\n- parameter\\_search\\_analysis.py: Runs the analysis one multiple simulation directories belonging to the same parameter search, distributed on multiple computational nodes and using by default Slurm for scheduling.\n- run.py: Runs the model. Defines which experimental protocol (as defined in experiments.py) and which analysis (as defined in analysis_and_visualization.py) will be run. By default runs the fullfield drifting grating and natural images protocol.\n- run\\_analysis.py: Runs only the analysis on the model on a mozaik datastore.

        "description": "Connectome-based modeling of large-scale brain network dynamics enables causal in silico interrogation of the brain\u2019s structure-function relationship, necessitating the close integration of diverse neuroinformatics fields. Here we extend the open-source simulation software The Virtual Brain (TVB) to whole mouse brain network modeling based on individual diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI)-based or tracer-based detailed mouse connectomes. We provide practical examples on how to use The Virtual Mouse Brain (TVMB) to simulate brain activity, such as seizure propagation and the switching behavior of the resting state dynamics in health and disease. TVMB enables theoretically driven experimental planning and ways to test predictions in the numerous strains of mice available to study brain function in normal and pathological conditions.\n\nTVMB opens a new set of research possibilities: it allows researchers, from different fields, to easily build specific/ individual mouse brains (using various resolutions, weighting definitions and parcellations), to simulate different dynamical behaviors (using diverse neural population models, numeri- cal integration schemes, and simulated neuroimaging mo- dalities) and finally to analyze the results.\nHowever, while TVMB is a highly generic framework, its underlying mathematical framework and simulation techniques make standard assumptions, among which the two most essential are that (1) the average activity of large populations of neurons is a meaningful quantification of the phenomena to be modeled and (2) the statistics of white matter fibers sufficiently describes how regions interact. Both resting state dynamics and seizure propagation, as demonstrated above, satisfy these assumptions. On the other hand, for example, fine grained spike timing effects would not well described within TVMB\u2019s mathematical framework.\nTVMB thus offers not only a conceptual framework to interpret neuroimaging data but, combined with experimental approaches, it also offers an operative framework to investigate the causal links between structure and function in the brain.\n\nReferences:\nF.

        "description": "The timing of activity across brain regions can be\ndescribed by its phases for oscillatory processes, and\nis of crucial importance for brain functioning. The\nstructure of the brain constrains its dynamics through\nthe delays due to propagation and the strengths\nof the white matter tracts. We use self-sustained\ndelay-coupled, non-isochronous, nonlinearly damped\nand chaotic oscillators to study how spatio-temporal\norganization of the brain governs phase lags between\nthe coherent activity of its regions. In silico results\nfor the brain network model demonstrate a robust\nswitching from in- to anti-phase synchronization by\nincreasing the frequency, with a consistent lagging of\nthe stronger connected regions. Relative phases are\nwell predicted by an earlier analysis of Kuramoto\noscillators, confirming the spatial heterogeneity of\ntime delays as a crucial mechanism in shaping the\nfunctional brain architecture. Increased frequency and\ncoupling are also shown to distort the oscillators by\ndecreasing their amplitude, and stronger regions have\nlower, but more synchronized activity. These results\nindicate specific features in the phase relationships\nwithin the brain that need to hold for a wide range of\nlocal oscillatory dynamics, given that the time delays\nof the connectome are proportional to the lengths of\nthe structural pathways.\n\nPetkoski S, Jirsa VK. 2019\nTransmission time delays organize the brain\nnetwork synchronization.

        "description": "We have developed a novel model in which grid cells combine path integration and environmentally anchored sensory information to generate an optimal estimation of the animal\u2019s current location within an environment. In this framework, the firing of the grid cell population represents a distribution of position probability across space. Path integration is performed by translating this distribution in proportion to the movement of the animal, with associated noise. Sensory information is provided by place cell inputs, whose weights are learned upon exposure to a novel environment. The localisation and learning features together constitute a neurally plausible system capable of performing simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) [Durrant-Whyte and Bailey 2006]. Weight stabilisation allows the model to account for place cell stabilisation in pre-weanling pups ([Chen et al., in prep], laboratory of Francesca Cacucci, SP3 collaborator). Nonuniform place cell densities can re-create grid cell firing pattern distortions ([3]; figure not shown), and grid patterns rescale in response to environmental manipulations (Figure 1H; [Chen et al., in prep]). Finally reciprocal connections between place and grid cells can produce a change of grid scale in response to changes in path integration gain, with subsequent but diminished effects on the location of associated place cells (Chen et al. (2018), submitted; SP3 collaborator). Simulations have been implemented in Matlab.\n\n\n\nChen G, Lu Y, King JA, Cacucci F, Burgess N.

        "description": "A broad set of studies in the field of value-based decision-making has long argued the role of orbitofrontal cortex in encoding the value of alternative reward offers to be chosen. Among other aspects, the community has wondered whether neural populations encoding alternative reward values do so via spatial segregation or by temporal alternation. In our model, we provide evidence for time-resolved alternation of the encoding of alternative offers, which are encoded by spatially overlapping groups of cells.\n\nWhen combined with the analysis of simultaneous eye tracking data, our model provides insights about the way neural content relates to the value of the two alternative offers. In particular, we find that the encoding of alternative values matches the inspected offer presentation sites, both during offer presentation and at later delay times when the display screen is left blank and subjects are left free to direct their gaze at their will.\nCombined, our results allow making predictions about the activation and reactivation of the encoding of value during task execution time, both when subjects inspect presented stimuli and when they are freely exploring the visual display, following stimuli presentation.\n\nTo reproduce the results, it is necessary to download the whole repository archive, and run `behavioralAnalysis.m` or `neuralAnalysis.m`.\nTo generate new predictions, it is necessary to store the fit linear models and simply apply the models to new data.\nThis is straightforward on Matlab: \n```if fit_data=fitglm(x_data,y_data); then y_pred=fit_data.predict(x_new) or y_pred=predict(fit_data, x_new)```.",

        "description": "During SGA2, the CNRS partner has worked on a framework for building mean-field models using a semi-analytic procedure which allows one to design mean-field models even for complex neurons. This formalism was applied to gradually more complex models such as the leaky integrate and fire (IF) model (work in SGA1), the AdEx model (di Volo et al., 2019, Fig.5) [4] and more recently the Hodgkin-Huxley model (Carlu et al., 2020) [2]. This formalism will be used in SGA3 to design mean-field models to even more complex neuronal types, with dendrites. The mean-field approach was also extended to model Up-Down state dynamics, using either a mean-field model with adaptation (di Volo et al., 2019) [4] or a state-dependent formalism (Capone et al., 2020) [1]. The mean-field model approach was combined with voltage-sensitive dye recordings in awake monkey, to account for propagating waves of activity in V1, and how such propagating waves participate to visual information processing (Chemla et al., 2019) [3]. This study was very important for modeling because it allowed us to calibrate mean-field models and create \"networks of mean-fields\", applied here to V1 recordings. The same approach will be continued in SGA3, towards larger scales, as reviewed in a recent paper (Goldman et al., 2019) [5].\nThis model is now implemented in The Virtual Brain (TVB). This implementation (joint work with Viktor Jirsa in Marseille) is in progress and is described in the EITN deliverable.\n\nA copy of the code of this model was put in open-access on [ModelDB]( https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/ShowModel?model=263236#tabs-1)\n\n\n\n### References\n\n[1] Capone, C., di Volo, M., Romagnoni, A., Mattia, M. and Destexhe, A.

        "description": "Architecture of phase relationships among neural oscillations is central for their functional significance but has remained theoretically poorly understood. We use phenomenological model of delay-coupled oscillators with increasing degree of topological complexity to identify underlying principles by which the spatio-temporal structure of the brain governs the phase lags between oscillatory activity at distant regions. Phase relations and their regions of stability are derived and numerically confirmed for two oscillators and for networks with randomly distributed or clustered bimodal delays, as a first approximation for the brain structural connectivity. Besides in-phase, clustered delays can induce anti-phase synchronization for certain frequencies, while the sign of the lags is determined by the natural frequencies and by the inhomogeneous network interactions. For in-phase synchronization faster\noscillators always phase lead, while stronger connected nodes lag behind the weaker during frequency depression, which consistently arises for in-silico results. If nodes are in antiphase regime, then a distance \u03c0 is added to the in-phase trends. The statistics of the phases is calculated from the phase locking values (PLV), as in many empirical studies, and we scrutinize the method's impact. The choice of surrogates do not affects the mean of the observed phase lags, but higher significance levels that are generated by some surrogates, cause decreased variance and might fail to detect the generally weaker coherence of the interhemispheric links. These links are also affected by the non-stationary and intermittent synchronization, which causes multimodal phase lags that can be misleading if averaged.\nTaken together, the results describe quantitatively the impact of the spatio-temporal connectivity of the brain to the synchronization patterns between brain regions, and to uncover mechanisms through which the spatio-temporal structure of the brain renders phases to be distributed around 0 and \u03c0.\n\nPetkoski S, Palva JM, Jirsa VK (2018)\nPhase-lags in large scale brain synchronization:\nMethodological considerations and in-silico\nanalysis.

The saccade generator, being responsible for the initiation of the movement, is located in the reticular formation, a part of the brainstem, and consists of a variety of subpopulations grouped by electrophysiological properties of the neurons, which for instance exhibit bursty or tonic firing.\n\nOur model of the saccade generator is based on  \"A neural model of the saccade generator in the reticular formation\" by Gancarz and Grossberg, Neural Networks, 1998. In contrast to their work, we use interconnected recurrent spiking neural networks, thereby being able to capture bursty dynamics on the single-neuron level. The model consists of four subpopulations which are wired in such a way that upon stimulation of the input population not only a suitable output signal is generated, but also the network is reset to its initial state.",

        "description": "In contrast with our everyday experience using brain circuits, it can take a prohibitively long time to train a computational system to produce the correct sequence of outputs in the presence of a series of inputs. This suggests that something important is missing in the way in which models are trying to reproduce basic cognitive functions. In this work, we introduce a new neuronal network architecture that is able to learn, in a single trial, an arbitrary long sequence of any known objects. The key point of the model is the explicit use of mechanisms and circuitry observed in the hippocampus, which allow the model to reach a level of efficiency and accuracy that, to the best of our knowledge, is not possible with abstract network implementations. By directly following the natural system\u2019s layout and circuitry, this type of implementation has the additional advantage that the results can be more easily compared to the experimental data, allowing a deeper and more direct understanding of the mechanisms underlying cognitive functions and dysfunctions and opening the way to a new generation of learning architectures.",

        "description": "Humans and other animals learn to extract general concepts from sensory experience without extensive teaching. This ability is thought to be facilitated by offline states like sleep where previous experiences are systemically replayed. However, the characteristic creative nature of dreams suggests that learning semantic representations may go beyond merely replaying previous experiences. We support this hypothesis by implementing a cortical architecture inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs). Learning in our model is organized across three different global brain states mimicking wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM), and REM sleep, optimizing different, but complementary, objective functions. We train the model on standard datasets of natural images and evaluate the quality of the learned representations. Our results suggest that generating new, virtual sensory inputs via adversarial dreaming during REM sleep is essential for extracting semantic concepts, while replaying episodic memories via perturbed dreaming during NREM sleep improves the robustness of latent representations. The model provides a new computational perspective on sleep states, memory replay, and dreams, and suggests a cortical implementation of GANs.\n\nInstructions for using the model are given in the file `README.md`.\nThis version of the code was used for the article Nicolas Deperrois, Mihai A Petrovici, Walter Senn, Jakob Jordan (2022) Learning cortical representations through perturbed and adversarial dreaming. eLife 11:e76384.",

        "description": "### Introduction\n\nThe hippocampus is a complex structure of the brain which is part of the limbic system, and it is mainly involved in the development of long-term memory and spatial memory. In fact, the hippocampus makes use of the grid cells present in the entorhinal cortex to generate place cells, specific types of neurons that fire when the animal enters a particular place in the environment. What allows an animal to learn how to navigate in this environment is the basal ganglia (BG) circuit, composed of many subnuclei located in different areas of the brain: this circuit, thanks to a neurotransmitter called dopamine, changes the synaptic strengths of the striatum, a subnucleus of the BG, and makes the animal be able to select actions in its environment in order to maximize some reward, a mechanism very similar to reinforcement learning.\n\nStoianov et al. proposed a probabilistic model which simulates the functioning of these neural circuits, and tested it on three different tasks on a Y-maze environment: in the first task (cue conditioning), every final position had a 100% probability to give a reward, while on the second task (context conditioning) the reward probabilities varied depending on the room; finally, a third task was performed (contextual conditioning) with reward probabilities of 0% in order to check the spatial preferences learned by the robot during the previous phases of training. The rodent was able to find out the reward locations that yielded a higher probability to get the reward. However, the model was tested on a simple environment without a realistic agent and sensors, though a noise term was added for the retrieval of the position and direction of the rodent, and for the execution of the actions.\n\nIn order to find out how this model would perform in a realistic scenario, we integrated it on the NRP and performed simulations on more complex environments. The NRP is a simulation infrastructure that aims to bridge the gap between neuroscience and robotics by providing biologically realistic brain models to virtually embodied agents, and vice versa. For these simulations, we employed the Husky robot, an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with four wheels and realistic sensors.\n\n### NRP Integration\n\nIn order to integrate the Matlab model in the Neurorobotics Platform (NRP), we utilized the Matlab engine, a Python package that allows executing Matlab function from Python scripts. The simulation environment, including initialization of the world, execution of actions and visiting reward locations, is handled by the NRP, while the Matlab functions for control and learning are called from Python through the Matlab engine.\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1, we tested the model on three different mazes: a simple grid with 8 reward locations, a T-maze with 6 reward locations, and a 4 rooms environment with 12 reward locations. The Husky robot uses a physically realistic laser scan to check if there are obstacles nearby, in order to stop when it is approaching a wall.\n\n![Figure 1](https://object.cscs.ch/v1/AUTH_64bf8536ad8b4872a4121f909be7e82f/Falotico/hippocampus-ventral-striatum/figures/fig1_900px.png)\n\n### Results\n\nFig. 2 shows the metric scores for the simple environment, Fig. 3 represents the scores for the T-maze, while Fig. 4 shows the scores for the 4 rooms environment. Both simulations consisted of 1000 trials.\n\nIn order to assess the model performances in a robotic scenario, we relied on the four metrics used on the original work: (i) accuracy (number of trials where the rodent finds a reward location over the number of trials); (ii) path length of each trial (a lower path length means that the rodent found the reward location in few steps); (iii) sweep depth for each trial; (iv) decision certainty of the rodent.\n\nAs can be seen from the scores, the Husky robot is able to learn the first two tasks, while the decision certainty decreases; on the other hand, it has more difficulties learning the third task, due to the increased complexity of the environment.\n\n![Figure 2](https://object.cscs.ch/v1/AUTH_64bf8536ad8b4872a4121f909be7e82f/Falotico/hippocampus-ventral-striatum/figures/fig2_600px.png)\n![Figure 3](https://object.cscs.ch/v1/AUTH_64bf8536ad8b4872a4121f909be7e82f/Falotico/hippocampus-ventral-striatum/figures/fig3_600px.png)\n![Figure 4](https://object.cscs.ch/v1/AUTH_64bf8536ad8b4872a4121f909be7e82f/Falotico/hippocampus-ventral-striatum/figures/fig4_600px.png)",

We investigated the propagation of LFPs, induced by extracellular electrical current injections via patch-pipettes, in acute rat brain slice preparations containing the somatosensory cortex in vitro using multielectrode arrays. Based on our data, we determined the cortical tissue conductivity over a 100-fold increase in signal frequency (5-500 Hz). Our results imply at most very weak frequency-dependent effects within the frequency range of physiological LFPs. Using biophysical modeling, we estimated the impact of different putative impedance spectra. Our results indicate that frequency dependencies of the order measured here and in most other studies have negligible impact on the typical analysis and modeling of LFP signals from extracellular brain recordings.",

        "description": "The processing of visual information by the human eye can be described as a concatenation of multiple functional stages. Three import stages in this process are the absorption of photonic input by photoreceptors such as rod and cones, the integration of the output of these photoreceptors by bipolar cells, followed by the integration of the output of the bipolar cells by the retinal ganglion Cells. Due to the non-linear distribution of all three cell types along the retina, these processes can be viewed as a sequence of non-linear resampling of the visual input in which each stage builds on the representational output of the previous stage. The distribution of cells, for each cell type, portrays a densely distributed central region, with an incrementally decreasing cell density as the angle of visual eccentricity increases. This results in a high-resolution central vision and a low-resolution representation of peripheral vision. When normalizing the distance between the cells, the representational output will be a wheelbarrow-like distorted image in which the peripheral areas are compressed, compared an intact and high-resolution foveal representation. Overall, the process can be described as non-linear down-sampling method in which the central parts are preserved and the amount of compression for peripheral areas is a function of the visual angle of eccentricity. In deep learning based visual models this process are often overlooked or simplified. Therefore, we propose a biological plausible functional model of non-linear down-sampling. Most computational vision models such as deep convolutional neural networks, start their processing at the level of V1 filtering. As the observation of non-uniform mapping (cortical magnification) of visual input onto the striate cortex is considered to be explained by the retinal ganglion cell density, the distribution of these cells is considered to be the primary functional module that leads to cortical magnification. The currently proposed Retinal Compression Algorithm (RCA) uses the distribution of these cells to compute a biologically plausible approximation of the Ganglion cells\u2019 compression function, and can be considered for initial processing stages of larger computational vision models.",

The architecture forms an encoder-decoder structure and includes a module with multiple convolutional layers at different dilation rates to capture multi-scale features in parallel. Moreover, we combine the resulting representations with global scene information for accurately predicting visual saliency. The network is based on a lightweight image classification backbone and hence presents a suitable choice for applications with limited computational resources to estimate human fixations across complex natural scenes.",

        "description": "Abstract: The brain exhibits capabilities of fast incremental learning from few noisy examples, as well as the ability to associate similar memories in autonomously-created categories and to combine contextual hints with sensory perceptions. Together with sleep, these mechanisms are thought to be key components of many high-level cognitive functions. Yet, little is known about the underlying processes and the specific roles of different brain states. In this work, we exploited the combination of context and perception in a thalamo-cortical model based on a soft winner-take-all circuit of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons. After calibrating this model to express awake and deep-sleep states with features comparable with biological measures, we demonstrate the model capability of fast incremental learning from few examples, its resilience when proposed with noisy perceptions and contextual signals, and an improvement in visual classification after sleep due to induced synaptic homeostasis and association of similar memories.\n\nAuthor Summary: We created a thalamo-cortical spiking model (ThaCo) with the purpose of demonstrating a link among two phenomena that we believe to be essential for the brain capability of efficient incremental learning from few examples in noisy environments. Grounded in two experimental observations\u2014the first about the effects of deep-sleep on pre- and post-sleep firing rate distributions, the second about the combination of perceptual and contextual information in pyramidal neurons\u2014our model joins these two ingredients. ThaCo alternates phases of incremental learning, classification and deep-sleep. Memories of handwritten digit examples are learned through thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical plastic synapses. In absence of noise, the combination of contextual information with perception enables fast incremental learning. Deep-sleep becomes crucial when noisy inputs are considered. We observed in ThaCo both homeostatic and associative processes: deep-sleep fights noise in perceptual and internal knowledge and it supports the categorical association of examples belonging to the same digit class, through reinforcement of class-specific cortico-cortical synapses. The distributions of pre-sleep and post-sleep firing rates during classification change in a manner similar to those of experimental observation. These changes promote energetic efficiency during recall of memories, better representation of individual memories and categories and higher classification performances.\n\nNote: this model is a substantial improvement of \"Thalamo-cortical spiking model with sleep-like slow oscillations improving awake visual classification through synaptic homeostasis and memory association\" (https://search.kg.ebrains.eu/instances/4c1d05ee-2e51-4e00-9415-28673228a9f0; doi:10.1038/s41598-019-45525-0)",

The primate visual system, by contrast, contains abundant recurrent connections. Recurrent signal flow enables recycling of limited computational resources over time, and so might boost the performance of a physically finite brain or model. Here we show: (1) Recurrent convolutional neural network models outperform feedforward convolutional models matched in their number of parameters in large-scale visual recognition tasks on natural images. (2) Setting a confidence threshold, at which recurrent computations terminate and a decision is made, enables flexible trading of speed for accuracy. At a given confidence threshold, the model expends more time and energy on images that are harder to recognise, without requiring additional parameters for deeper computations. (3) The recurrent model\u2019s reaction time for an image predicts the human reaction time for the same image better than several parameter-matched and state-of-the-art feedforward models. (4) Across confidence thresholds, the recurrent model emulates the behaviour of feedforward control models in that it achieves the same accuracy at approximately the same computational cost (mean number of floating-point operations). However, the recurrent model can be run longer (higher confidence threshold) and then outperforms parameter-matched feedforward comparison models. These results suggest that recurrent connectivity, a hallmark of biological visual systems, may be essential for understanding the accuracy, flexibility, and dynamics of human visual recognition.\n\n_Technical documentation URL_: [link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/677237v5)\n\n_User documentation URL_: [link](https://github.com/cjspoerer/rcnn-sat/blob/master/README.md)\n\n_Release URL for NEST integration of information theoretic PKL Neurons_: [link](https://github.com/sepehrmn/nest-simulator/tree/bpid_kp_2017)\n ",

In addition to ensuring methods reproducibility (see the definition [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2017.00076/full)), this allows you to explore the data in an interactive way.\n\nThe process is very simple, everything you need to do is:\n1) Clone or download the repository\n2) Run the notebook `Generate_Figures.ipynb` using Jupyter [here a guide for beginners](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n#### Reuse the whisker system model in your experiment\n**Target**: expert NRP users\n\nYou can re-run the virtual experiment or reuse the components we have developed (i.e., the mouse robot model provided with the four whiskers, the control system, the transfer functions, or the state machine).\n\nHere we provide all the files that are needed, however this is not a straightforward process and some previous experience with the NRP is a pre-requisite.\nIf you are totally new to the NRP, we suggest to follow the [tutorials for beginners](https://neurorobotics.net/Documentation/latest/nrp/tutorials.html) first.\n\n1) **The first step is to install the NRP.** You can find all information on how to download and install a local version of the NRP [here](https://neurorobotics.net/access-the-nrp.html). We recommend to use the [docker installation](https://neurorobotics.net/Documentation/latest/nrp/user_manual/docker_installation.html#docker-installation), since it facilitates a lot the procedure. Remember that the system has been developed and tested with the NRP version 3.1 and version 3.2.\n2) Once you have your docker version of the NRP, you can **import the experiment**. To do so, you need to:\n    - Download as zip this repository\n    - Open the NRP\n    - Go to \"My experiments\"\n    - Click on \"Import zip\" and select the repository zip file you have downloaded\n    - You will see the messagge \"1 successfully imported zip files\"\n    - You will see the experiment called \"Whisking experiment\" in your experiments list\n    - You can launch the experiment and modify it as it pleases you or re-use components (i.e., the various Python files that are contained) to generate the experiment that you prefer.\n\nFor any problem, do not hesitate to open an Issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alberto-antonietti/paper_whisking/issues).\nThis is the version used for the paper: \"Brain-inspired spiking neural network controller for a neurorobotic whisker system\" by Alberto Antonietti, Alice Geminiani, Edoardo Negri, Egidio D'Angelo, Claudia Casellato, and Alessandra Pedrocchi.

        "description": "Cortical slow oscillations (SO) of neural activity spontaneously emerge and propagate during deep sleep and anesthesia and are also expressed in isolated brain slices and cortical slabs. We lack full understanding of how SO integrate the different structural levels underlying local excitability of cell assemblies and their mutual interaction. Here, we focus on ongoing slow waves (SWs) in cortical slices reconstructed from a 16-electrode array designed to probe the neuronal activity at multiple spatial scales. In spite of the variable propagation patterns observed, we reproducibly found a smooth strip of loci leading the SW fronts, overlapping cortical layers 4 and 5, along which Up states were the longest and displayed the highest firing rate. Propagation modes were uncorrelated in time, signaling a memoryless generation of SWs. All these features could be modeled by a multimodular large-scale network of spiking neurons with a specific balance between local and intermodular connectivity. Modules work as relaxation oscillators with a weakly stable Down state and a peak of local excitability to model layers 4 and 5. These conditions allow for both optimal sensitivity to the network structure and richness of propagation modes, both of which are potential substrates for dynamic flexibility in more general contexts",

        "description": "[![OSB Logo](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/images/osblogo.png)](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/potjansdiesmann2014/)\n\nMicrocircuit model of early sensory cortex from [Potjans and Diesmann (2014)](https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhs358), displaying asynchronous irregular activity with layer-specific firing rates similar to the activity observed in cortex in the awake spontaneous condition. The inhibitory neurons have higher firing rates than the excitatory neurons, despite being modeled with identical intrinsic properties. Hence, this feature arises due to the connectivity of the network.\n\nThe model represents the approximately 80,000 neurons under a square mm of cortical surface, organized into layers 2/3, 4, 5, and 6. Each layer contains an excitatory and an inhibitory population of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with current-based synapses, connected with delays. The population-specific connectivity and external Poisson inputs are based on the integration of anatomical and physiological data mainly from cat V1 and rat S1. The possibility is included of providing an additional thalamic stimulus to layers 4 and 6, which propagates across layers in a realistic fashion partly due to the target specificity of feedback projections across layers.\n\n### History\n\nThe original model code used NEST's native simulation language SLI. The SLI version included in the NEST distribution and accessible via Open Source Brain (OSB) is a simplification of Tobias Potjans's original code. For convenience and legibility, a version with the PyNEST interface was later created and also included in the NEST distribution. Furthermore, a PyNN-version was developed in the context of porting the model to SpiNNaker. This was adjusted and included as an example in the PyNN distribution. All these versions implement exactly the same model. Padraig Gleeson since created a NeuroML2-version and added tests to all versions of the code on OSB. \n\n### Scientists involved in the model:\n\n**SLI implementation:** Tobias Potjans, Markus Diesmann, David Dahmen, Tom Tetzlaff, Sacha van Albada, Han-Jia Jiang, Hans Ekkehard Plesser, Jochen Eppler, H\u00e5kon M\u00f8rk, Stine Brekke Vennemo, Padraig Gleeson\n\n**PyNEST implementation:** Johanna Senk, Hendrik Rothe, Hannah Bos, Sacha van Albada, Han-Jia Jiang, Sara Konradi, Alexander van Meegen, Jochen Eppler, H\u00e5kon M\u00f8rk, Stine Brekke Vennemo, Jessica Mitchell, Padraig Gleeson, Markus Diesmann\n\n**PyNN implementation:** Sacha van Albada, Johanna Senk, Andrew Davison, Andrew Rowley, Maximilian Schmidt, Padraig Gleeson, Jannis Schuecker\n\n**NeuroML2 implementation**: Padraig Gleeson\n\n### Reference\n\nTobias C.

        "description": "A model of synapses in the developing somatosensory cortex.\n\nThis model is associated with the article:\n\nTiina Manninen, Ausra Saudargiene, and Marja-Leena Linne (2020) Astrocyte-mediated spike-timing-dependent long-term depression modulates synaptic properties in the developing cortex. *PLoS Comput Biol* [DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008360](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008360)\t\n\nThe code was developed and tested on Linux with Python 3.7. The prerequisites include numpy, scipy, and tqdm. To install these libraries on Linux type in terminal: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`\n\nTo run:\n\n1) In terminal, run: `python run_pairings.py`\n\nThis command will run the t-LTD induction protocol, thus 20 simulations with the different temporal differences of post-pre pairing protocol (-10 ms, -20 ms,..., -200 ms) and saves the data to separate folders (altogether 77.8 GB). Please, modify the path where to save the data, if needed. Note that the temporal differences of the post-pre pairings are implemented in the code as positive values, whereas they have negative values in the article. The reason for this is that we set the postsynaptic stimuli to occur at fixed time points in all the simulations whereas the presynaptic stimuli occurred in varying time points after the postsynaptic stimuli depending on temporal difference used, and not the other way around.\n\n2) In terminal, run: `python run_before_and_after_pairings.py`\n\nThis command will run the protocols before (baseline) and after t-LTD induction and saves the data to separate folders (altogether 9.9 GB). Please, modify the path where to save the data, if needed. Baseline protocol is run only once, but the protocol after t-LTD induction is run 20 times, thus once for each corresponding temporal difference in the t-LTD induction protocol. The protocol after t-LTD induction needs the actual end values of f_pre from the t-LTD induction protocol, and the values are given in `run_before_and_after_pairings.py` file. If you modify the model, you need to change these values in the code to the values your model gives after running `run_pairings.py`.\n\nPlotting can be done with the given example MATLAB code: `plotting_post_pre_pairing_data.m`. It will plot in separate figures, the inputs, the saved model state variables, and the other saved output variables for a certain temporal difference of the post-pre pairing protocol. You can easily modify the path to your data to plot also the simulation results from the protocols before and after t-LTD induction.\n\nIn addition to the above two python files, the model includes presynaptic (`preneuron.py`) and postsynaptic (`postneuron.py`) neurons and an astrocyte\n(`astrocyte.py`). More details of the model are given below.

        "description": "Long-range dependence (LRD) has been observed for several years in the spiking activity of neurons. Often, this is interpreted as originating from a non-Markovian system. In this model, we show that a purely Markovian integrate-and-fire (IF) model, with a noisy slow adaptation term, can generate interspike intervals (ISIs) that appear as having LRD. We compare it For comparison with a new model of individual IF neuron with fractional (non Markovian) noise. The correlations of its spike trains are studied and proven to have LRD, unlike classical IF models.\n\nThe mathematical models write\n\n$$dV_t = (\\mu_V - \\lambda_V V_t + \\gamma Z_t)dt + \\sigma dB_t^\\alpha$$\n\n$$dZ_t = (\\mu_{Z,t} - \\lambda_Z Z_t)dt + \\sigma'd\\tilde{B}_t^\\alpha.$$\n\nWhere $\\(Z\\)$ contains the adaptation part ($\\(\\gamma = 0\\)$ stands for the model without adaptation). The noises $(B_t^\\alpha$) and \\(\\tilde{B}_t^\\alpha\\) are fractional  Brownian motions (fBm) of scaling parameter $\\(\\alpha\\in(0,1)$.\nThe spike trains are modeled as the successive times where the membrane potential variable $\\(V\\)$ crosses a fixed deterministic threshold. At such times, $\\(V\\)$ is reset to a fixed value.\nWe have compared two fundamentally different cases:\n- Markov case: $\\(\\alpha = 0.5\\)$ and $\\(\\gamma\\neq 0\\)$\n- Non Markov case: $\\(\\alpha\\neq 0.5\\)$ and $\\(\\gamma = 0\\)$.\nFor each model, we use the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and the Rescaled  Range Statistics (R/S) to evaluate the Hurst parameter (see figures).\n\nThe main conclusion is that for a fixed (and small) number of Interspikes Intervals, it is impossible to discriminate if the data have been simulated with the Markov or the non Markov setting. However, the evolution of the curves as a function of the size of the spikes train give better results.\n\nPublication :\nAn integrate-and-fire model to generate spike trains with long-range dependence\nA.

        "description": "Corrected Four-Sphere Head Model for EEG Signals\n\nThe EEG signal is generated by electrical brain cell activity, often described in terms of current dipoles. By applying EEG forward models we can compute the contribution from such dipoles to the electrical potential recorded by EEG electrodes. Forward models are key both for generating understanding and intuition about the neural origin of EEG signals as well as inverse modeling, i.e., the estimation of the underlying dipole sources from recorded EEG signals. Different models of varying complexity and biological detail are used in the field. One such analytical model is the four-sphere model which assumes a four-layered spherical head where the layers represent brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), skull, and scalp, respectively. While conceptually clear, the mathematical expression for the electric potentials in the four-sphere model is cumbersome, and we observed that the formulas presented in the literature contain errors. Here, we derive and present the correct analytical formulas with a detailed derivation. A useful application of the analytical four-sphere model is that it can serve as ground truth to test the accuracy of numerical schemes such as the Finite Element Method (FEM). We performed FEM simulations of the four-sphere head model and showed that they were consistent with the corrected analytical formulas. For future reference we provide scripts for computing EEG potentials with the four-sphere model, both by means of the correct analytical formulas and numerical FEM simulations.",

        "description": "This is a computational model of active whisking based on the framework of active inference, which describes action and perception as guided by an overall process of minimisation of prediction errors (Friston, 2005; Rao & Ballard, 1999); or more formally, a minimisation of variational free energy (Friston, 2010; Parr et al., 2022). The computational model is inspired by previous findings about how rats and mice adapt their whisking kinematics to optimise their whisker placement during tactile sensing. Across several studies, it emerged that rats and mice use an anticipatory strategy to adapt their whisker amplitude to the distance (and location) in which they expect to encounter objects (Voigts et al., 2015). In other words, they might form an internal prediction based on a (memorised) expectation of the location of an object and adapt their whisking behaviour accordingly. To explain these findings, we adopt an active inference perspective and hypothesize that the brain generates object-specific predictions about whisker protractions and touches and treats unexpected whisker contacts as prediction error signals (discrepancies between the expectation and reality), to be minimised by adjusting whisker behaviour.",

        "description": "Here, we provide a simulation of a cortical-like module endowed with activity-dependent adaptation. Fundamental aspects of the local responses elicited in mammals by direct cortical stimulation can be replicated by systematically varying the relationships between adaptation strength and excitation level in the network.\n\nThe spiking neuron network presented here has been adapted from [Torao-Angosto et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2021.609645). The network was built using anatomical data collected in the literature on L5 of the visual cortex of sleeping and anesthetized rats (v1).\n\nMore specifically the network parameters were chosen to model a self-consistent network of Layer 5 neurons each having an average number of pre-synaptic connections computed considering the connection probabilities described in [Markram et al. (2015)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.609645/full#B17), the cellular densities reported in [Beaulieu (1993)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.609645/full#B2) and the exponential decay of the cortico-cortical connectivity across layers reported in [Schnepel et al. (2015)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.609645/full#B34) and in [K\u00e4tzel et al. (2011)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.609645/full#B14) for excitatory and inhibitory pre-synaptic sources, respectively. As result, excitatory neurons received on average 2,910 (129) synaptic contacts from E (I) neurons, while the inhibitory ones received 746 (45) connections from E (I) pre-synaptic cells. To model a 1 mm<sup>2</sup>-patch of the cortex only 2% of excitatory connections were considered to be recurrent. Synaptic efficacies were set to have\u2014under mean-field approximation\u2014a fixed point with a firing rate of 0.75 Hz and 4.375 Hz for excitatory and inhibitory neurons ([Watson et al., 2016](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.609645/full#B37)), respectively.\n\nThen the network is made of interconnected leaky integrate-and-fire excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Excitatory neurons incorporate the activity-dependent fatigue mechanism modeling spike-frequency adaptation (SFA), which is a key ingredient to generate Up-Down slow oscillations typical of deep sleep and anesthesia. We provide the Python code, and associated explanations, to generate dynamics for several adaptation and excitation levels.\n\nThe instructions for running the simulations are inserted into the Jupyter notebook (`Simulations_spiking\n neuron network.ipynb`) as comments.",

The scaffold is designed to integrate the cerebellar cortex with deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), including different neuronal types: Golgi cells, granule cells, Purkinje cells, stellate cells, basket cells, and DCN principal cells. Mossy fiber inputs were conveyed through the glomeruli. Reconstruction follows sequential steps: cells placement in 3D space and connectome according to geometric rules.

Hence, we extend the WTA model to include switching behaviour. Switching implies that the two populations compete and alternate between high and low firing activity. Without such a mechanism, a simple WTA model would stay forever in one attractor state. A probable underlying mechanism for switching behaviour is the existence of a negative feedback loop between motor and visual neurons.",

        "description": "Precise spike timing as a means to encode information in neural\n                  networks is biologically supported, and is\n                  advantageous over frequency-based codes by\n                  processing input features on a much shorter\n                  time-scale. For these reasons, much recent attention\n                  has been focused on the development of supervised\n                  learning rules for spiking neural networks that\n                  utilise a temporal coding scheme. However, despite\n                  significant progress in this area, there still lack\n                  rules that have a theoretical basis, and yet can be\n                  considered biologically relevant. Here we examine\n                  the general conditions under which synaptic\n                  plasticity most effectively takes place to support\n                  the supervised learning of a precise temporal\n                  code. As part of our analysis we examine two\n                  spike-based learning methods: one of which relies on\n                  an instantaneous error signal to modify synaptic\n                  weights in a network (INST rule), and the other one\n                  relying on a filtered error signal for smoother\n                  synaptic weight modifications (FILT rule). We test\n                  the accuracy of the solutions provided by each rule\n                  with respect to their temporal encoding precision,\n                  and then measure the maximum number of input\n                  patterns they can learn to memorise using the\n                  precise timings of individual spikes as an\n                  indication of their storage capacity. Our results\n                  demonstrate the high performance of the FILT rule in\n                  most cases, underpinned by the rule\u2019s\n                  error-filtering mechanism, which is predicted to\n                  provide smooth convergence towards a desired\n                  solution during learning. We also find the FILT rule\n                  to be most efficient at performing input pattern\n                  memorisations, and most noticeably when patterns are\n                  identified using spikes with sub-millisecond\n                  temporal precision. In comparison with existing\n                  work, we determine the performance of the FILT rule\n                  to be consistent with that of the highly efficient\n                  E-learning Chronotron rule, but with the distinct\n                  advantage that our FILT rule is also implementable\n                  as an online method for increased biological\n                  realism.\nversion as published at http://dx.doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0161335",

        "description": "The quest to understand how the structural network of interconnections shapes brain function lies at the heart of the field of brain connectivity. So far, we still lack a unitary model of the relationship between the shape of the brain\u2019s connectome and the emergent activity patterns. One of the main reasons is that interactions between different brain areas do not only depend on the structure of the connectome but also on the local and global dynamics characterizing a given brain state, such as rest, sleep, and anesthesia. The existence of different state dependent activity patterns sustained by the same underlying anatomy exposes how elusive is the relationship between the network structure and function.\n\nThis model, named as *topological similarity*, is an analytical estimate of the contribution of the structural brain connectivity alone on the cross-correlations between brain areas, discarding the influence of higher order dynamical influences. The model is based on three axiomatic assumptions on the diffusion of influence or information over the network:\n\n1. In a network, information travels along all possible paths (with equal probability). Very often, network approaches of information transmission consider only the shortest paths.\n2. Information content (or signal power) decays with path distance. This assumption implies that despite information travels along all possible paths, shorter paths are still more influencial than longer paths.\n3. Two brain regions are correlated if they receive inputs from the same sources.\n\nThe first two assumptions define how information travels along a network and determine how much the dynamics of one brain region affected the dynamics of any other brain region. Given that the structural connectivity is encoded by the weighted adjacency matrix **A**, where A(i,j) > 0 if there is a link pointing from region *i* to region *j* and A(i,j) = 0 if no such link exist, then the influence between any pair of nodes can be quantified by the communicability measure *C*. By definition, communicability is the matrix exponential of the adjacency matrix, *C* = exp(g**A**), which is a weighted sum of the powers of the adjacency matrix, and *g* is a parameter for global coupling strength.\n\n$$\\mathcal{C} = e^{gA} = \\mathbf{1} + gA + \\frac{(gA)^2}{2!}  + \\frac{(gA)^3}{3!} + \\ldots$$\n\n$$\\mathcal{T} = \\frac{\\left< \\mathbf{c}\\_i, \\mathbf{c}\\_j \\right>}{|\\mathbf{c}\\_i| \\, |\\mathbf{c}\\_j|}$$\n\nApplying this model to structural human brain connectivity we were able to estimate the cross-correlations between brain regions which are expected in resting-state only due to the connectivity alone, Fig. 1(M) for one hemisphere and Fig. 1(N) for the whole brain. Comparing to empirically observed functional connectivities via fMRI during resting-state, Fig. 1(E) and (F), we could quantify that the shape of the brain's connectome only accounts for up to 45% of the empirical functional connectivity.\n\n\n#### Publications\n\nR.G.

        "description": "Many problems can be decomposed into series of subproblems that are solved sequentially. When the subproblems are solved, relevant intermediate results have to be stored and propagated from one subproblem to the next, until the overarching goal has been completed. The same applies for visual tasks that can be decomposed into sequences of elemental visual operations: experimental evidence suggests that for visual tasks, intermediate results are stored in working memory as an enhancement of neural activity in the visual cortex. The focus of enhanced activity is then available for subsequent subroutines to act upon. However, it remains unknown how those dynamics can emerge in neural networks that are trained with only rewards, as animals are.\n\nHere, we propose a new recurrent architecture capable of solving composite visual tasks in a reinforcement learning context. We trained neural networks on three visual tasks for which electrophysiological recordings of monkeys\u2019 visual cortex are available and updated weights following RELEARNN, a biologically plausible four-factor Hebbian learning rule, which is local both in time and space. The networks learned an abstract, general rule and selected the appropriate sequence of elemental operations, solely based on the characteristics of the visual stimuli and the reward structure.\n\nThe activity of the units of the neural network resembled the activity of neurons in the visual cortex of monkeys solving the same tasks. Relevant information that needed to be exchanged between subroutines was maintained as a focus of enhanced activity and passed on to the subsequent subroutines. Our results demonstrate how a biologically plausible learning rule can train a recurrent neural network on multistep visual tasks.",

        "description": "In the arousal process from sleep and anesthesia, the brain restores its integrative and complex activity from the synchronized state of slow wave activity (SWA) characteristic of NREM sleep. The mechanisms and dynamics of the cortical network underpinning this state transition remain however to be elucidated. Here we investigated the progressive shaping of SWA propagating through the cortex on the way to wakefulness. Using micro-electrocorticographical recordings in the mouse, we pharmacologically increased levels of slow-wave frequency and complexity from deep unconsciousness toward wakefulness, and probed several single neuronal assemblies throughout the whole cortex. We found a form of memory in the SWA at deep anesthesia, with a tight alternation of posterior-anterior-posterior modes of slow-wave propagation. When approaching wakefulness, metastable patterns of spiking cortical activity propagated in many more directions, reflecting an increased complexity in the network dynamics. We unveil a temporal component of the dynamics of the waves\u2019 mesostates, predicted by simulations of a model network of spiking neurons and confirmed in our experimental data. Local excitability suffices to explain the transition from sleep to wakefulness without requiring modifications of the network connectivity. These results shed new light on the functional re-organization of the cortical network in the awakening brain.",

        "description": "This is a spiking model of all 32 vision-related areas of macaque cortex in the parcellation of Felleman and Van Essen (1991) implemented in NEST. Each area is modeled as a square mm microcircuit with the full density of neurons and synapses, leading to a total of 4 million neurons and 2.4 billion synapses. The neurons are modeled using the leaky integrate-and-fire model. Each microcircuit consists of layers 2/3, 4, 5, and 6 with an excitatory and inhibitory population each (except parahippocampal area TH, which lacks layer 4). All neurons receive independent Poisson spike trains as input. The cortico-cortical connectivity is based on a recent release of the CoCoMac database, quantitative tracing data (Markov et al., 2014), and predictive connectomics. The resulting connectivity matrix possesses a community structure that reflects functional groupings.\n\nThe model reproduces resting-state dynamics including area-level functional connectivity similar to that measured with fMRI, a spectrum of spiking activity and distribution of spike rates in V1 close to those from electrophysiological measurements (Chu et al. 2014), and propagation of activity across areas mainly in the feedback direction, aking to findings during visual imagery and sleep. The match with multi-scale experimental data occurs when the model is in a metastable state where multiple time scales of activity appear. The model enables layer-specific feedforward and feedback propagation between areas to be analyzed. The full model requires a high-performance cluster or supercomputer to be run, but a downscaling option is available.\n\nThe anatomical description of the model, including derivations of the population sizes and connectivity, is available in \nSchmidt M, Bakker R, Hilgetag CC, Diesmann M, van Albada SJ. *Multi-scale account of the network structure of macaque visual cortex* (2018) Brain Struct Func. 223(3):1409-1435.

Physically, the organization of the retina meets these constraints by densely packing photoreceptors within a small central region, the fovea, and letting photoreceptor density decrease rapidly towards the periphery. Functionally, this arrangement introduces a challenge for the visual system since only the region of external space fixated by the eyes is resolved with high acuity.

The software is intended to run on the SpiNNaker neuromorphic hardware along with the sPyNNaker software package, the solver was developed with SpyNNaker7 so its use with later versions would require updating. The main source file is `spinnaker_csp/snn_creator.py`, the code on this file creates a network which connectivity encodes the constraint satisfaction problem, it also adds Poisson spike-sources to every population defining a possible value of a variable in the network. The constraints are encoded as inhibitory connections between such populations and the Poisson sources allow the network firing to relax in a configuration which violates the lesser constraints. Formally, this corresponds to a stochastic search over the state space defined by the problem variables and constraints, hence the solver inherits some advantage and disadvantage of stochastic searches. In particular, the solver is general in the sense of being applicable to any problem formulable as a set of variables with their respective domains and inequality constraints between those variables, but it does not solve all problems exactly and optimally, as well as is susceptible to local minima. The solver performance then depends on the problem complexity and its usefulness depends on whether the user desires always exact solutions or approximations are good. The repository includes an examples folder with scripts that use the solver to find solutions to the map-colouring, Sudoku puzzles and spin lattices problems.\n\nSee:\n\nFonseca Guerra GA and Furber SB (2017) Using Stochastic Spiking Neural Networks on SpiNNaker to Solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems.

        "description": "A Multisensory Predictive Coding implementation designed to work with visual and tactile data from WhiskEye, either as a physical robot or a simulation on the Neurorobotics Platform. The goal is to produce useful internal representations of a complex environment that are suitable for place recognition and other navigation tasks.\n\n## WhiskEye\n\nWhiskEye\\[1\\] is a rat-inspired, biomimetic robot that explores its environment with a whisker array, cameras and other internal sensors. For the purposes of this model, it gathers visual, tactile and odometry data. The robot explores the world according to the features it finds most salient, enabling it to autonomously map the environment in a lifelike way, with learning algorithms, including implementations of predictive coding, building flexible representations of its surroundings in multiple modalities.\n\n## MultiPredNet\n\nThe MultiPredNet draws on an implementation of predictive coding\\[2\\] and combines it with a multi-modal sensing architecture\\[3\\]. Built from a neural network upon the Tensorflow\\[4\\] framework, it is formed of several layers of bidirectional neurons, with a 'stack' of these layers corresponding to each distinct modality, or combination thereof. This particular example deals with visual and tactile data, and thus has three stacks: visual, tactile, and visuo-tactile.\n\nHypothesised causes of sensory inputs are passed down each stack towards the sensory input (back-to-front). Simultaneously, the input sensory signals subtract from these causes at each level, and the error fed back (front-to-back) to update the neural network.\n\n## Place Recognition\n\nThe usefulness of the generated representations is analysed via examining an independent modality that the MultiPredNet had no knowledge of; the robot odometry. The assumption is made that a good, learned representation for place recognition will vary in a similar way to any other useful representation. In this case, pose space (x, y, $\\theta$) is used as a reference.\n\nPose space itself should not be expected to directly relate to the robot's internal representation, especially considering the learning algorithm was not conditioned to recapitulate pose space as part of its loss function. However, given that pose space can unambiguously represent 2D position and orientation - a requirement also given of any useful learned representation - it is expected that a learned representation will vary *in the same way* as pose space.\n\n## Representational Similarity Analysis\n\nRepresentational Similarity Analysis\\[5\\] allows for a robust metric of how fit for purpose this learned representation is. Such a determination is given by the Representational Similarity Matrix, a within-representation comparison of how similar instances within that representation are. Comparing the Matrices of different representations given the same visuo-tactile input, should, in a good metric, show that the two representations co-vary to a large degree. The exact degree of co-variance is given by the Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient; this is then used as a metric of how useful the learned representation is.\n\n## References\n\n\\[1\\] O.

        "description": "Ultra high-field MRI enables sub-millimetre resolution imaging of the human brain, allowing the study of functional circuits of cortical layers at the meso-scale. An essential step in many functional and structural neuroimaging studies is segmentation, the operation of partitioning the MR images in anatomical structures. Despite recent efforts in brain imaging analysis, the literature lacks in accurate and fast methods for segmenting 7 Tesla (7T) brain MRI. \n\nWe here present CEREBRUM-7T, an optimised end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), that allows fully automatic segmentation of a whole 7T T1w MRI brain volume at once, without partitioning the volume, preprocessing, nor aligning it to an atlas. The trained model is able to produce accurate multi-structure segmentation masks on six different classes plus background in only a few seconds. \n\n<img src=\"https://rocknroll87q.github.io/cerebrum7t/misc/graphical_abstract.png\" width=\"800\" alt=\"graphical abstract\">\n\nTo learn how to use CEREBRUM-7T from source code, docker, or singularity, please visit [https://rocknroll87q.github.io/cerebrum7t/usage](https://rocknroll87q.github.io/cerebrum7t/usage).\nFirst public release",

        "description": "This is a full-scale scaffold model of the human hippocampus CA1 area, based on data obtained from the analysis of histological human brain images, which are publicly available from the BigBrain J\u00fclich repository. A custom-made computational algorithm has been developed to extract from the images the positions of neuronal somata.\n\nA second custom made algorithm has been developed to connect neurons following morpho-anatomical landmarks. The full matrix of neuronal positioning together with the indices of connected neurons is provided as a connection matrix in order to be used for large-scale simulation with single point neurons.\n\n\nThe data are organized as follows:\n\n1. The Neuronal placement text file `HUMAN_PLACEMENT_4_8M_Pyr.txt` allows generating the complete human CA1 scaffold. It contains 4 columns containing the 3D coordinates and the GID (Global Index) of pyramidal cells and interneurons of the human CA1 hippocampus obtained from the image analysis of the histological sections of a full brain downloaded from the BigBrain repository.\n2. The connectivity matrices in the hdf5 files allow to generate the full matrix of connection pairs. Each dataset in the hdf5 files contains a set of 2-column arrays with the pairs of numbers indicating the GID of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons connected with the developed algorithm.\n3. The two directories `long_simdata_human_01ffa4a7-a809-43f5-83c1-5cc839a1dc52_only_exc_connections/` and `long_simdata_human_5f859adf-469c-4f37-89e6-9d2e13f776da_inh_movie_paper/` contain data generated by running simulations with either only the excitatory connections or both the excitatory and inhibitory connections, to allow the inspection of simulation results without having to run the simulations.\n\n## Instructions to run the model.\n\nThe scripts to run the simulation are in the `hippocampus_human_collab` directory. Running the model currently requires an account on Piz Daint at [CSCS](https://https://www.cscs.ch).\nThe model is made to run on NEST. NEST is available in a Docker image that has to be loaded using Sarus on Piz Daint. The script `sarus_load_image.sh` takes care of loading the Docker image `showcase_2.tar` on Sarus. The authors thank Lionel Kusch (Aix Marseille University) for the technical assistance in compiling the NEST simulator in a Docker image.\n\nTo run the model:\n\n- Download the following files and directories:\n    * `hippocampus_human_collab/placement_connections_scaffold.hdf5` (80 GB!!!)\n    * `inh_remapped/` (39 GB).\n- Copy the files `helper.py`, `synaptic_models.py`, `neuron_models.py` from  `\"long_simdata_human_01ffa4a7-a809-43f5-83c1-5cc839a1dc52_only_exc_connections/\"` to `\"hippocampus_human_collab/\"`.\n- Set the correct path `\"input_hdf5_data_dir\"` in the beginning of the `run_nest_serialized_connect.py` script to point to the location of the \n`placement_connections_scaffold.hdf5`\n- Set the correct account for HPC resources in `run_sarus_normal.sh`.\n- Run by executing the bash script: `Start_Human_Hippocampus.sh`\n\nThe script will create a directory in your $SCRATCH dir and store the simulation data.\n\nBefore running consider that a single simulation takes up to 3 hours to complete and uses 2400 CPU hours from your HPC account.\n\nFor support contact Sergio Solinas.",

        "description": "Computational modeling of brain circuits requires the definition of many parameters that are difficult to determine from experimental findings. One way to help interpret these data is to fit them using a particular kinetic model. The classic and widely used bi-exponential synaptic conductance change does not capture well the resulting variabilities of the IPSCs. Most importantly, however, it cannot give much information on the subcellular pathways underlying synaptic transmission. A relatively basic model for gephyrin was implemented. \n \nThere are three main reasons for this choice:  \n\n1. it is one of the major players for synaptic transmission, and of particular importance in inhibitory synapses  \n\n2. we were able to implement a specific kinetic model simple enough to be, at the same time, informative and analytically solvable, and  \n\n3. we plan to carry out soon (for a future paper) experiments using a new type of antibody to selectively block Gephyrin ex vivo, to compare experimental data with the model's prediction.  \n\n\nFor a more detailed description of the model see Lupascu CA, Morabito A, Merenda E, et al.

In order to elicit the CaMKII/PP1-dependent response, the calcium and dopamine inputs should arrive in temporal proximity and must follow a specific (dopamine after calcium) order. In this computational study, we propose that these temporal requirements emerge as a result of the coordinated signaling via two striatal phosphoproteins, DARPP-32 and ARPP-21.

        "description": "Based on previous work on human episodic memory (the so-called Byrne, Becker and Burgess-model; Byrne et al. 2008) we have built a model of how neural representations of egocentric spatial experiences in the parietal lobe interface with viewpoint-independent representations in medial temporal lobe, to enable many key aspects of spatial cognition. The model shows how specific, experimentally characterised, neural responses (place cells, head-direction cells, boundary- and object-vector cells, grid cells, and parietal gain-field neurons) map onto higher cognitive function in a modular way. The interactions between these populations of neurons across multiple brain regions provide a mechanistic account of spatial memory, scene construction, novelty-detection, and mental navigation. In particular the model shows how so-called object vector cells (OVCs) may allow memory for items to be incorporated into a contextual representation based on extended environmental boundaries (as expressed in the firing of boundary vector cells; or BVCs). The same cells provide the neural correlate of objects in context during recall/visuospatial imagery (cf. Figure). Simulations have been implemented in MatLab (using rate coded neurons).\n\nBicanski A, Burgess N. A neural-level model of spatial memory and imagery.

        "description": "Voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDi) has revealed fundamental properties of neocortical processing at macroscopic scales. Since for each pixel VSDi signals report the average membrane potential over hundreds of neurons, it seems natural to use a mean-field formalism to model such signals. Here, we present a mean-field model of networks of Adaptive Exponential (AdEx) integrate-and-fire neurons, with conductance-based synaptic interactions. We study a network of regular-spiking (RS) excitatory neurons and fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons. We use a Master Equation formalism, together with a semi-analytic approach to the transfer function of AdEx neurons to describe the average dynamics of the coupled populations. We compare the predictions of this mean-field model to simulated networks of RS-FS cells, first at the level of the spontaneous activity of the network, which is well predicted by the analytical description. Second, we investigate the response of the network to time-varying external input, and show that the mean-field model predicts the response time course of the population. Finally, to model VSDi signals, we consider a one-dimensional ring model made of interconnected RS-FS mean-field units. We found that this model can reproduce the spatio-temporal patterns seen in VSDi of awake monkey visual cortex as a response to local and transient visual stimuli. Conversely, we show that the model allows one to infer physiological parameters from the experimentally-recorded spatio-temporal patterns.\nThis implementation provides the code to run three types of numerical simulations. \n\n1. A local network model (typically 5000 neurons,  implementation based on Brian2) of sparsely connected AdExp neurons (RS and FS types), \n2. the mean-field equations describing the evolution of the population activity of this biophysical model, 3. a mesoscopic model describing a ~5mm area of the cortex, based on the interconnections of the local mean-field model.",

        "description": "Behavioural and neural data suggest that multiple strategies and brain systems support learning about reward. Reinforcement learning (RL) considers these strategies in terms of model-based (MB) learning, which involves learning an explicit transition model of the available state-space, or model-free (MF) learning, which involves directly estimating the cumulative future reward associated with each state. The MB-MF distinction parallels that between place learning and response learning within spatial navigation. Lesion and inactivation studies suggests that dorsal hippocampus (dHC) underlies both MB and place learning, whereas dorsolateral striatum (DLS) underlies MF and response learning. Here, we present a computational model of the dHC and DLS contributions to reward learning that applies to spatial and nonspatial domains. In the model, hippocampal place cell firing reflects the geodesic distance of other states from its preferred state along the graph of task structure. Accordingly, this population can support a value function or goal cell firing rate, via one-shot learning, on which gradient ascent corresponds to taking the shortest path on the graph, behaviour associated with MB planning. In contrast, the DLS learns through MF stimulus-response associations with egocentric environmental cues. We show that this model reproduces animal behaviour on spatial navigation tasks using the Morris Water Maze and the Plus Maze, and human behaviour on non-spatial two-step decision tasks. We discuss how the geodesic place cell fields could be learnt, and how this type of representation helps to span the gap between MB and MF learning. The generality of our model, originally shaped by detailed constraints in the spatial literature, suggests that the hippocampal-striatal system is a general-purpose learning device that adaptively combines MB and MF mechanisms.  \n\n[Detailed description of simulations and results](https://github.com/bicanski/HBPcollab/blob/master/Striatal_v_hippocampal_nav_v2/Modelling_hippocampal_and_dorsolateral_striatal_contributions_to_learning_across_domains.pdf)",

        "description": "The occurrence of sleep passed through the evolutionary sieve and is widespread in animal species. Sleep is known to be beneficial to cognitive and mnemonic tasks, while chronic sleep deprivation is detrimental. Despite the importance of the phenomenon, a complete understanding of its functions and underlying mechanisms is still lacking. \nIn this simplified thalamo-cortical model, trained to encode, retrieve and classify images of handwritten digits, we show interesting effects of deep-sleep-like slow oscillation activity. During slow oscillations, spike-timing-dependent-plasticity (STDP) produces a differential homeostatic process. It is characterized by both a specific unsupervised enhancement of connections among groups of neurons associated to instances of the same class (digit) and a simultaneous down-regulation of stronger synapses created by the training. This hierarchical organization of post-sleep internal representations favours higher performances in retrieval and classification tasks. The mechanism is based on the interaction between top-down cortico-thalamic predictions and bottom-up thalamo-cortical projections during deep-sleep-like slow oscillations. Indeed, when learned patterns are replayed during sleep, cortico-thalamo-cortical connections favour the activation of other neurons coding for similar thalamic inputs, promoting their association. Such mechanism hints at possible applications to artificial learning systems.\n\nReference\nCristiano Capone, Elena Pastorelli, Bruno Golosio, Pier Stanislao Paolucci.

        "description": "Learning to make adaptive decisions depends on exploring options, experiencing their consequence, and reassessing one\u2019s strategy for the future. Although several studies have analyzed various aspects of value-based decision-making, most of them have focused on decisions in which gratification is cued and immediate. By contrast, how the brain gauges delayed consequence for decision-making remains poorly understood.\n\nTo investigate this, we designed a novel decision-making task in which each decision altered future options to decide upon. The task was organized in groups of inter-dependent trials, and the participants were instructed to maximize cumulative reward value within each group. In the absence of any explicit performance feedback, the participants had to test and internally assess specific criteria to make decisions. The absence of explicit feedback was key to specifically study how the assessment of consequence forms and influences decisions as learning progresses.\n\nWe formalized this operation mathematically by means of a multi-layered decision-making model. It uses a mean-field approximation to describe the dynamics of two populations of neurons which characterize the binary decision-making process. The resulting decision-making policy is dynamically modulated by an internal oversight mechanism based on the prediction of consequence. This policy is reinforced by rewarding outcomes. The model was validated by fitting each individual participants\u2019 behavior. It faithfully predicted non-trivial patterns of decision-making, regardless of performance level.\n\nThese findings provide an explanation to how delayed consequence may be computed and incorporated into the neural dynamics of decision-making, and to how adaptation occurs in the absence of explicit feedback.\n\nTo run the model, download the code from the GitHub link, and save it in your computer. Open MATLAB, set the current folder to the one where you saved the files, and run the main script called `script_main.m`. Follow the instructions displayed in the command window.\nThis is the first public release of the model.",

        "repository": "https://modeldb.science/245417",
        "description": "In hippocampus, a type of slowly-activated and non-inactivating K+ channels, belonging to the Kv7 family, are highly localized on initial segments of myelinated and unmyelinated axons where they influence neuronal excitability. Interestingly, immunohistochemistry shows that the KV7.2 and KV7.3 subunits are localized throughout hippocampal mossy fibers. Electrophysiological recordings from mature synaptic boutons showed that the KV7/M- current is also present here, is active at rest and enhances the membrane conductance. The current also reduces the spike half-width and afterdepolatization (ADP) following a presynaptic spike. This is likely to have significant consequences for the modulation of excitatory neurotransmitter release from these boutons, and thus signal transmission, at DG-CA3 synapses. We implemented a biophysical computational model of a mossy fiber bouton (MFB) in order to highlight the mechanisms underlying the ADP observed after Kv7 channels block. The model is able to reproduce a number of experimental findings under control and after Kv7 current block by XE991. The results suggest that Kv7 conductance limits spike-induced rise in Ca2+ concentration and regulates spike width and ADP amplitude. The model suggests that the ADP is caused by a relatively slow Ca2+-dependent mechanism, which can be conveniently modelled as a slow deactivation time constant of the Ca2+ current in MFB. This is a new feature that has not been previously observed experimentally. Taken together, these results suggest that presynaptic Kv7 channels expression at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse may have an important role in modulating synaptic transmission and signal coding in the hippocampus network.\n\nFor a more detailed description of the model see:\n\nMartinello, K., Giacalone, E., Migliore, M., Brown, D. A., & Shah, M. M. (2019). The subthreshold-active KV7 current regulates neurotransmission by limiting spike-induced Ca2+ influx in hippocampal mossy fiber synaptic terminals. *Communications biology*, **2**, 145.

        "description": "### Abstract\n\nThe promise of artificial intelligence in understanding biological vision relies on the comparison of computational models with brain data with the goal of capturing functional principles of visual information processing. \nConvolutional neural networks (CNN) have successfully matched the transformations in hierarchical processing occurring along the brain's feedforward visual pathway extending into ventral temporal cortex. \nHowever, we are still to learn if CNNs can successfully describe feedback processes in early visual cortex. \nHere, we investigated similarities between human early visual cortex and a CNN with encoder/decoder architecture, trained with self-supervised learning to fill occlusions and reconstruct an unseen image. \nUsing Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), we compared 3T fMRI data from a non-stimulated patch of early visual cortex in human participants viewing partially occluded images, with the different CNN layer activations from the same images. \nResults show that our self-supervised image-completion network outperforms a classical object-recognition supervised network (VGG16) in terms of similarity to fMRI data. \nThis provides additional evidence that optimal models of the visual system might come from less feedforward architectures trained with less supervision. We also find that CNN decoder pathway activations are more similar to brain processing compared to encoder activations, suggesting an integration of mid- and low/middle-level features in early visual cortex. \nChallenging an AI model to learn natural image representations via self-supervised learning and comparing them with brain data can help us to constrain our understanding of information processing such as neuronal predictive coding.\n\n### Model\n\nOur self-supervised image-to-image model is trained to reconstruct the occluded image section (always the lower-right quadrant); it is a fully-CNN, with a encoder/decoder architecture and with skip connections (known as U-Net and described in Ronneberger et al. (2015). Details on layer activation dimensions are shown in Figure 2B. Every layer implements the same components: a two-dimensional convolution with a 3\u00d73 filter and stride=2 (that downsamples the activations, no pooling used), batch normalisation, and a rectified linear unit (ReLu) function for encoder and a leaky ReLu2 for decoder. We added padding to keep the activation dimensions constant after convolution and adopted dropout during the training to decrease overfitting. \n\nWe trained the network similarly to what has been proposed in Isola et al. (2017), in which not only the mapping from input image to output image (i.e., network filters) is learned, but also the best loss function to evaluate (or train) this mapping. The selection of the learning strategy, and in particular the loss, is crucial in unsupervised learning, where labels or categories are not available. Early unsupervised models adopted custom loss functions hand crafted by the experimenter; for example, autoencoders use the mean squared error (MSE) between the original image and the generated to compute the loss and the relative gradient. Variational autoencoders (Kingma & Welling, 2013), a combination of autoencoders with statistical inference, add a term to the MSE loss measuring how closely the latent variables match specific distributions (for example, unit gaussian). However, MSE produces blurry images and VAEs fail to generate good-looking images because they are not able to parametrise precisely the complex distributions of images. A successful approach to overcome the hand-crafted selection of a loss function is to let the network learn it: this can be accomplished using conditional generative adversarial neural networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014). The training was carried out using images from the SUN database (Xiao et al., 2010, the same database where the testing images came from), with occluded images as input to the network and original images (without occlusion) as output. We discarded some images from the database because they were too low resolution (< 200\u00d7200 pixels), leading to a total of \u2248107,000 images for the training.3 We trained the model and its 228M parameters with epochs=5 and batch_size=5 and the training process lasted for \u224849 hours on a GeForce 1080Ti.

        "description": "Many clinical and research studies of the human brain require an accurate structural MRI segmentation. While traditional atlas-based methods can be applied to volumes from any acquisition site, recent deep learning algorithms ensure very high accuracy only when tested on data from the same sites exploited in training (i.e., internal data). The performance degradation experienced on external data (i.e., unseen volumes from unseen sites) is due to the inter-site variabilities in intensity distributions induced by different MR scanner models, acquisition parameters, and unique artefacts. To mitigate this site-dependency, often referred to as the scanner effect, we propose LOD-Brain, a 3D convolutional neural network with progressive levels-of-detail (LOD) able to segment brain data from any site. Coarser network levels are responsible to learn a robust anatomical prior useful for identifying brain structures and their locations, while finer levels refine the model to handle site-specific intensity distributions and anatomical variations. We ensure robustness across sites by training the model on an unprecedented rich dataset aggregating data from open repositories: almost 27,000 T1w volumes from around 160 acquisition sites, at 1.5 - 3T, from a population spanning from 8 to 90 years old. Extensive tests demonstrate that LOD-Brain produces state-of-the-art results, with no significant difference in performance between internal and external sites, and robust to challenging anatomical variations. Its portability opens the way for large scale application across different healthcare institutions, patient populations, and imaging technology manufacturers. Code, model, and demo are available at the [project website](https://rocknroll87q.github.io/LOD-Brain/).\nFirst released version.",

Front. Comput. Neurosci. 13:68. \n\ndoi: 10.3389/fncom.2019.00068.\n\nSensorimotor signals are integrated and processed by the cerebellar circuit to predict accurate control of actions. In order to investigate how single neuron dynamics and geometrical modular connectivity affect cerebellar processing, we have built an olivocerebellar Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based on a novel simplification algorithm for single point models (Extended Generalized Leaky Integrate and Fire, EGLIF) capturing essential non-linear neuronal dynamics (e.g., pacemaking, bursting, adaptation, oscillation and resonance). EGLIF models specifically tuned for each neuron type were embedded into an olivocerebellar scaffold reproducing realistic spatial organization and physiological convergence and divergence ratios of connections. In order to emulate the circuit involved in an eye blink response to two associated stimuli, we modeled two adjacent olivocerebellar microcomplexes with a common mossy fiber input but different climbing fiber inputs (either on or off). EGLIF-SNN model simulations revealed the emergence of fundamental response properties in Purkinje cells (burst-pause) and deep nuclei cells (pause-burst) similar to those reported in vivo. The expression of these properties depended on the specific activation of climbing fibers in the microcomplexes and did not emerge with scaffold models using simplified point neurons. This result supports the importance of embedding SNNs with realistic neuronal dynamics and appropriate connectivity and anticipates the scale-up of EGLIF-SNN and the embedding of plasticity rules required to investigate cerebellar functioning at multiple scales.",

While those models could reasonably reproduce the time-averaged functional connectivity of the brain at rest, they have failed to capture its temporal fluctuations. The reason, we find, is the type of local dynamics those models used to characterise the local dynamics of brain regions. To explore identify the type of local dynamics giving rise to realistic fluctuations we define a whole brain network model where the local dynamics of the brain regions are characterised by the canonical form of the Hopf bifurcation.\n\nThe model considers the structural connectome for the human brain extracted via diffusion tensor imaging and tractography. The corresponding connectivity is encoded into the weighted adjacency matrix **_A_** where *A(i,j) > 0* if there is a link pointing from region *i* to region *j* and *A(i,j) = 0* if no such link exist. The local dynamics *z(i,t)* of a brain region is characterised by the Hopf normal form,\n\n$\\dot{z} = (a + jw)z - z|z^2| + \\beta \\eta(t)$,  (Eq. 1)\n\nwhere *z(i,t)* is a complex variable and *\u03b7(i,t)* is an additive external Gaussian noise each region receives. The noise each region receives is independent. The local dynamics of each region *i* depends on two parameters:\n\n- *a(i)*, the bifurcation parameter, and\n- *\u03c9(i)*, the natural frequency of the region.\n\nThe bifurcation parameter sets the dynamical mode of the brain region. If *a < 0* the local dynamics are characterised by the external noise *\u03b7(i,t)* fluctuating around the fix point *z(t) = 0*. If *a > 0* then *z(t)* oscillate. In the vecinity of *a = 0* the local dynamics are characterised by small noisy oscillations due to stochastic resonance. See Fig. 1.\n\nGiven the BOLD signals from resting-state fMRI, the natural frequencies *\u03c9(i)* for each brain region are determined from the experimental data. While Eq. (1) represents the equation for each region, Eq. (2) represents the dynamics of the coupled system, where *g* is a global coupling parameter and the brain regions are diffusively coupled.\n\n$\\dot{z}\\_i = (a\\_i + jw\\_i)z\\_i - z\\_i|z\\_i^2| + g \\sum\\_{k=1}^N A (z\\_k - z\\_i) + \\beta\\_i \\eta\\_i(t)$,   (Eq. 2)\n\nUsing this model we could reveal the dynamical \ncortical core of the human brain, which is driving the activity of the rest of the whole brain, see Fig. 2.\n\n\n### Publications\n\n**G.

The results of the example simulation are saved automatically in the notebook folder as .npy files in case of that the user wants to analyze the results. This option can be commented out without causing to the proper functioning of the rest of the notebook. The default values for the simulations are provided and they can be easily changed by the user.\n\n## Code overview\n\n`MainNotebook.ipnyb`: This is the main notebook to run the simulations and the case studies. It contains explanations related to the model and to the simulations. This file uses the .py files given below.\n\n`cell library.py`: It contains the parameters of the biophysical cell properties of the neurons. Do not change unless you add new cell types.\n\n`DiffOperator.py`: It contains the stochastic differential equations of the AdEx mean-field equations corresponding to both cortical columns.\n\n`NeuronConnectivity.py`: It contains the functions which we use to load the transfer functions of Regular Spiking (RS) and Fast Spiking (FS) cells. The transfer functions and their parameters are based on a fitting to experimental data, therefore the parameters should be kept fixed.

        "description": "Point neuron models for the main cell types of the basal ganglia nuclei are developed in order to facilitate biologically realistic simulations of basal ganglia using spiking neural networks. The mathematical formalism of adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neuron models proved to be adequate for the task. It allows to preserve sufficient details of the dynamics of the system at the single-cell and network levels. Spiking point neuron models serve as an intermediate abstraction level between the biophysically detailed models which rely on the reconstructed morphology and electrophysiology of individual cells [1] and more abstract models describing the mean-field neuronal activity within a larger brain area. The latter models are more suitable for integration within The Virtual Brain and interactive co-simulations of multiple brain areas like in the RisingNet initiative of EBRAINS.\n\nParameters of AdEx neuron model for main cell types of the basal ganglia nuclei can be found at the [home page of the project](https://github.com/a1eko/bglite): dSPN, iSPN and FS cells of dorsal striatum [1], prototypical and arkypallidal cells of GPe, as well as generic principal cells of STN and SNr [2].\n\nSpecification of AdEx models and single-cell simulation code can be found in the directory `models/cells`. Models of the striatal cells, dSPN, iSPN and FS, are constrained by experimental data in `models/cells/expdata` first used for the [detailed striatal model]((https://kg.ebrains.eu/search/instances/Model/a6458de3-a176-4378-9b03-34a26f5da3bd)) [1].

        "description": "The Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a form of neurodegenerative dementia which causes a progressive decline in cognitive functions. For over 25 years, AD research has been based on the so-called amyloid hypothesis as the main cause of the disease. Its involvement on brain circuit alterations and cellular derailments in very early stages is still under intense investigation. Many studies have been focused on the importance of dopamine and its role within the hippocampal circuitry during AD progression, especially as an early hallmark of the disease. We implemented a computational model that is able to support experimental findings, and suggest experimentally testable predictions, on the cellular mechanisms underlying the early changes in firing properties and the impaired excitability experimentally observed in ventral CA1 pyramidal neurons of Tg2576 mice. The model suggests that the early appearance of cells entering into a depolarization-block state, can be related to an alteration of sodium and potassium currents. In particular, we found that both a shift of sodium channel activation kinetics and the alteration of specific potassium conductances (KDR and KCa) can underlie the altered firing behavior. These results suggest that the early perturbation in the expression or functional involvement of these channels can play a significant role in modulating AP firing behavior of Tg2576 ventral CA1 pyramidal neurons.\n\nFor a more detailed description of the model see: \n\nSpoleti, E., Krashia, P., La Barbera, L., Nobili, A., Lupascu, C.
